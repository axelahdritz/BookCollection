["The Hand of the Unseen\n\nIr was with feelings of savage glee that I returned homewards\nfrom the Gare du Nord where I had parted from my little\nwife. She was going to our child, who had fallen ill in a distant\nland. So now I had accomplished the sacrifice of my heart. Her\nlast words, \u201cWhen shall we meet again?\u2019 and my answer,\n\u2018Soon,\u2019 still echoed in my ears as an untruth, a deception that\nI was unwilling to admit, even to myself, though something\nin me whispered that we had now parted for ever. Those fare-\nwell words that we exchanged in November 1894 were in fact\nour last, for up to the present time, May 1897, I have never\nseen my dear wife again.\n\nWhen I got as far as the Caf\u00e9 de la R\u00e9gence I sat down at a\ntable at which I had often sat with my wife, my beautiful\nwardress, who had spied upon my soul day and night, had\nguessed my secret thoughts, kept watch over the development\nof my ideas, observed with jealous resentment the striving of\nmy spirit towards the unknown.\n\nRestored to the world of the free, I became aware of a\nsudden expansion of my self that elevated me above the petty\ncares of life in the great city, that scene of intellectual strife,\nwhere I had just won a victory\u2014no great thing in itself, but to\nme of enormous significance, representing as it did the fulfil-\nment of a youthful dream. A play of mine had been performed\nat a Paris theatre, the dream of all contemporary authors in my\ncountry, but one which I alone had realized. But now the\ntheatre was repellent, as is everything that one has attained, and\nscience attracted me. Compelled to choose between love and\nknowledge, I had made up my mind that I would try to reach\n\n21\n", "22 INFERNO\n\nthe summits of intellectual achievement, but in my willingness\nto make a sacrifice of my love I forgot the innocent victim of\nmy ambition\u2014or my vocation.\n\nBack once more in my miserable student\u2019s room in the\nLatin Quarter, I delved into my trunk and drew forth from\ntheir hiding place six crucibles of fine porcelain which I had\nrobbed myself to buy. A pair of tongs and a packet of pure\nsulphur completed the apparatus of my laboratory. All that\nremained to be done was to make a fire of furnace heat in the\nstove, secure the door, and draw down the blinds, for since the\nexecution of Caserio, only three months earlier, it had become\ndangerous to handle chemical apparatus in Paris.\n\nNight fell, the flames of hell rose from the burning sulphur,\nbut towards morning I had ascertained the presence of carbon\nin sulphur, previously regarded as an elementary substance. By\ndoing this I believed I had solved the great problem, over-\nthrown the prevailing chemical theories, and won the only\nimmortality accorded to mortals.\n\nBut from my hands, roasted by the intense heat, the skin\nwas peeling off in scales, and the pain caused by the mere effort\nof undressing reminded me of what my victory had cost. Yet,\nalone in my bed, where the odour of woman still lingered, I\nwas blissful. A feeling of spiritual purity, of masculine virginity,\nmade me regard my past married life as something unclean,\nand I regretted that there was no one to whom I could render\nthanks for my deliverance from those degrading fetters, now\nbroken without much fuss. The fact is, that in the course of\nyears, as I came to notice that the unseen Powers left the world\nto its fate and showed no interest in it, I had become an atheist.\n\nSomeone to thank? There was no one, and the ingratitude\nthus forced upon me weighed me down.\n\nBeing jealously anxious about my discovery, I took no\nsteps to make it known. My shyness prevented me from\napproaching authorities on the subject or the academies. All\nthe same, I continued my experiments, but meanwhile my\nchapped hands became poisoned, the cracks widened, were\n", "THE HAND OF THE UNSEEN 23\nfilled with coke dust, blood oozed from them, and the agony\nbecame intolerable. Everything I touched caused me pain and\nI was in mind to ascribe my torment to those unknown Powers\nwhich, for so many years, had persecuted me and frustrated all\nmy endeavours. Almost mad with pain, I avoided and neg-\nlected my fellow men, refused invitations, drove my friends\nfrom me. Silence and solitude encompassed me, the stillness of\na desert, solemn, terrifying, in which I defiantly challenged the\nunseen Power to a wrestling match, body against body, soul\nagainst soul.\n\n[had proved the presence of carbon in sulphur; I now had\nto show that it contained hydrogen and oxygen, for they also\nmust be there. My apparatus was inadequate; I had no money,\nmy hands were black and bleeding, black as was my need,\nbleeding as was my heart. For during all this time I had been\ncarrying on a correspondence with my wife. I had told her of\nthe success of my chemical experiments and she had replied\nwith bulletins about our daughter, interspersed with warning\nhints about the futility of my scientific work and the imbecility\nof throwing away money on such things.\n\nIn an attack of righteous indignation, and overwhelmed by\na furious desire to do myself an injury, I committed suicide by\ndespatching an infamous, unpardonable letter, casting off wife\nand child for ever, and giving her to understand that I was\ninvolved in a new love affair.\n\nMy bullet hit the mark and my wife replied by demanding\na divorce.\n\nSolitary, guilty of suicide and assassination, my sorrow and\nanxiety made me forget my crime. No one came to see me,\nand I could seek out no one, as I had given offence to all. This\ngave me a feeling of exaltation, of drifting over the surface of\na sea, with my anchor weighed but without a sail.\n\nMeanwhile, necessity, in the form of my unpaid rent, made\nher appearance, interrupted my scientific work and meta~\nphysical speculations, and brought me down to earth once more,\n\nSuch was my state as Christmas drew near. I had rather\ncurtly refused an invitation to visit a Scandinavian family, as\ncertain painful irregularities made the atmosphere of their\n", "24 INFERNO\n\nhouse offensive to me. But in the evening, sitting alone, I re-\ngretted what I had done and went there all the same. No sooner\nwere we seated at table than the midnight revels began, with\na great deal of noise and unrestrained hilarity among the young\nartists, who were very much at home in that house. An in-\ntimacy that was repulsive to me, gestures and looks, in a\nword behaviour that was quite out of place in a family circle\nand caused me indescribable discomfort and depression. In the\nmidst of these saturnalian revels my sadness conjured up before\nmy inward eye my wife\u2019s peaceful dwelling. I had a sudden\nvision of the room, the Christmas tree, the mistletoe, my little\ndaughter, her deserted mother. Pangs of remorse seized me, I\nstood up, alleged that I was feeling unwell, and departed.\n\nI walked along the horrible Rue de la Gaiet\u00e9, but the arti-\nficial merriment of the crowds there wounded me. Then I\nwent along the silent, gloomy Rue Delambre, a street which,\nmore than any other in that quarter, can make one feel des-\nperate. I turned off into the Boulevard Montparnasse and sank\non to a chair outside the Brasserie des Lilas.\n\nFor a few moments a glass of good absinth gave me com-\nfort, but then I was attacked by a party of cocottes and students\nwho flicked me in the face with switches. As if pursued by the\nfuries, I left my absinth to its fate and hurried off to get myself\nanother at the Caf\u00e9 Francois Premier in the Boulevard Saint-\nMichel.\n\nI had only jumped out of the frying-pan into the fire.\nAnother lot of people came hallooing at me, \u2018Hi, hermit,\u2019 and\nI fled back to my house, whipped by Eumenides and escorted\nand unnerved by the triumphant strains of their mocking song.\nThe idea of a punishment, the consequence of a crime, never\noccurred to me. The part I was playing to myself was that\nof the innocent victim of unjust persecution. The unknown\nPowers were hindering me from carrying on my great work\nand it was essential to break through this hindrance if the\ncrown of victory were to be won.\n\nI had done wrong, and yet I was right and should be\nacknowledged right.\n\nI slept ill that Christmas Eve. A cold blast swept over my\n", "THE HAND OF THE UNSEEN 25\nface repeatedly and from time to time I was awakened by the\nstrains of a Jew\u2019s harp.\n\nA growing weakness of body and mind was gradually\ngetting the better of me. My black and bleeding hands made\nit impossible for me to dress myself neatly. My anxiety on\naccount of the rent I owed never gave me a moment's peace,\nand I paced up and down the room like a wild animal in a cage.\nI had given up eating regular meals and my landlord advised\nme to go to hospital; but this was no solution, as such places\nare expensive and demand payment in advance.\n\nThen the veins in my arms began to swell, a sure sign of\nblood-poisoning. This was the final blow, and news of it\nspread to my fellow countrymen. One evening the kind\nwoman from whose Christmas party I had so rudely and\nabruptly withdrawn\u2014the very person for whom I had felt\nsuch antipathy, whom I had almost despised\u2014sought me out,\nquestioned me, learned of the deep distress in which I found\nmyself, and, with tears in her eyes, tried to make me see that\nto go to hospital was my only hope.\n\nJudge how forlorn and contrite I felt when my eloquent\nsilence made it plain to her that I was without means. She was\nfilled with compassion at seeing me reduced to such a state of\nmisery. She herself was poor and oppressed by domestic cares\nand anxieties, but she announced that she would collect money\nfor me among the members of the Scandinavian community\nand that she would go to see their chaplain.\n\nThe woman who had sinned had been merciful to the man\nwho had just abandoned his truly wedded wife.\n\nOnce more reduced to beggary and appealing for charity\nthrough the agency of a woman, I began to suspect the exist-\nence of an unseen hand which was responsible for the irre-\nsistible logic of events. I bent before the storm, but was\ndetermined to rise again at the first possible moment.\n\nA cab took me to the H\u00e9pital de Saint-Louis. On the way\nthere I got out in the Rue de Rennes and bought two shirts,\nshrouds for my last hour!\n", "26 INFERNO\n\nThe idea that my death was imminent obsessed me. I\ncannot explain why.\n\nI was accepted as a patient and I was forbidden to go out\nunless I had obtained permission. My hands were swathed in\nbandages so that any sort of occupation was out of the\nquestion. I felt as if I were locked up in a prison.\n\nMy room was impersonal, bare, furnished only with abso-\nlute necessities, without a trace of beauty, and situated close to\nthe patients\u2019 common-room, where people smoked and played\ncards from morning till night.\n\nThe bell sounded for lunch, and at the table I found myself\namong a company of spectres. Faces like death\u2019s-heads, faces\nof the dying. A nose missing here, an eye there, a third with a\ndangling lip, another with a crumbling cheek. Two of the\nindividuals at the table did not look ill at all, but their expres-\nsion was sullen and despairing. They were master thieves of\ngood family who, thanks to their powerful relatives, had been\nlet out of prison on the grounds of illness. A nauseating smell\nof iodine took away my appetite; my bandaged hands obliged\nme to seck the assistance of my neighbours when I wanted to\ncut bread or pour myself out a drink. In the midst of this de-\nlightful company of criminals and those doomed to die there\nmoved our kind mother, the Matron, in her austere habit of\nblack and white, dealing out to each of us his poisonous\ndraught. I toasted a death\u2019s-head in a mug of arsenic; he\ntoasted me in digitalis. It was lugubrious and yet one had to\nbe grateful. Grateful, for anything so ordinary and at the same\ntime so offensive!\n\nPeople dressed and undressed me, tended me like a child.\nThe nun took a special fancy to me, treated me like a baby, and\ncalled me \u2018my child\u2019, while I, like all the others, called her\n\u2018Mother\u2019.\n\nHow wonderful it was to use that word \u2018mother\u2019, a word\nthat had not crossed my lips for thirty years. This elderly\nwoman, who belonged to the Augustinian Order, wore the\ngarb of the dead because she had never really lived her life. She\nwas gentle as resignation itself, and she taught us to smile at\nour sufferings as if they had been so many joys, for she knew\n", "THE HAND OF THE UNSEEN 27\nhow salutary pain can be. She never uttered a word of re-\nproach, she never admonished us, she never preached to us.\nShe knew the rule she must obey, that applying in secularized\nhospitals, and she knew too how to grant small liberties to her\npatients, though never to herself. For this reason she used to\nallow me to smoke in my room, even offered to roll the\ncigarettes for me, an offer I declined. She got me permission to\ngo out at other times than the usual hours and, when she dis-\ncovered that I busied myself with chemistry, she arranged that\nI should be introduced to the learned pharmacist in charge of\nthe hospital\u2019s dispensary. He lent me books and, after I had\nacquainted him with my theories on the nature of the elements,\nhe invited me to work in his laboratory. That nun did indeed\nplay a part in my life. I began to be reconciled to my fate and\npraised the fortunate misfortune that had brought me under\nthat blessed roof.\n\nThe first book I borrowed from the pharmacist\u2019s library\nopened of itself and my eye lighted like a falcon on a line in\nthe chapter on phosphorus. In a few words its author described\nhow the chemist Lockyer had shown by spectral analysis that\nphosphorus was not an elementary substance, adding that an\naccount of the experiment had been handed in to the Acad\u00e9mie\ndes Sciences in Paris, which had not rejected his findings.\n\nFeeling encouraged by this unexpected support for my\ntheories, I set off into the city, taking with me my crucibles and\nwhat remained of the incompletely burnt sulphur. Ihanded these\nover toafirmofanalytical chemists, who promised to give me, on\nthe morning of the following day, a certificate of their analysis.\n\nIt was my birthday. When I got back to the hospital I found\nawaiting me a letter from my wife in which she mourned my:\ncalamities and declared that she wanted to come to me in order\nto tend me and to love me.\n\nThe joy of knowing myself loved in spite of everything\nmade me feel I wanted to express my gratitude, but to whom?\n\nTo the Unknown, who for so many years had hidden from\nme?\n\nMy heart melted; I confessed to the base lie about my in-\nfidelity, I begged for her forgiveness, and in a trice I was\n", "28 INFERNO\n\ninvolved in an exchange of love-letters with my own wife,\nthough I nevertheless postponed our reunion until a more\nsuitable time.\n\nThe next morning I hurried off to my chemist in the\nBoulevard de Magenta. I carried back with me to the hospital\nthe certificate in its sealed envelope. As I passed the statue of\nSt Louis in the inner courtyard I recalled to mind the Saint\u2019s\nthree achievements, the great Asylum for the Blind, l\u2019Hospice\ndes Quinze-Vingts, the Sorbonne, and the Sainte-Chapelle,\nwhich I interpreted thus: from suffering, through knowledge,\nto penitence.\n\nIn my room, behind the closed door, I opened the envelope\nthat was to decide my future, and I read as follows:\n\n\u2018This powder, which has been handed in to us for investi-\ngation, has the following characteristics:\n\nColour: greyish black. Leaves a trace on paper.\n\nDensity: considerable, greater than the medium density\n\n' of graphite; the substance appears to be hard\ngraphite.\n\nChemical analysis:\n\nThis powder burns easily and in burning gives off carbon\n\nmonoxide and carbon dioxide. That is to say, it contains\n\ncarbon.\u2019\n\nSo pure sulphur contains carbon!\n\nI was saved. From this moment I should be able to prove\nto my friends and relations that I was not mad. This would\nconfirm the theories I had advanced in my work Antibarbarus,\npublished a year before, which had been treated by the news-\npapers as the work of a charlatan or a madman, with the result\nthat I had been cast off by my family as a good-for-nothing, a\nsort of Cagliostro.\n\nHa ha, thought I, now you are crushed, my worthy oppo-\nnents! My whole self swelled with righteous pride. I wanted\nto go into the city to cry aloud in the streets, roar in front of\nthe Institut, tear down the Sorbonne, but my hands were still\n", "THE HAND OF THE UNSEEN 29\nbandaged, and when I got out into the courtyard its tall\nrailings counselled me to have patience.\n\nThe hospital\u2019s pharmacist, to whom I had communicated\nthe results of the analysis, proposed that he should call together\na committee before whom I might demonstrate my thesis by\nan experiment on the spot.\n\nIn the meantime, rather than do nothing, and aware too of\nmy timidity when compelled to make a public appearance, I\nput together an article on the subject and sent it to Le Temps,\nwhere it was published within two days.\n\nThe password had been given. I had answers from various\nquarters, but no one denied the validity of my claims. I gained\nadherents. I was urged to send the article to a chemical periodi-\ncal and became involved in a correspondence that stimulated\nme to press on with the investigations I was pursuing.\n\nOne Sunday, the last that I spent in Saint-Louis, that place\nof purgatory, I was sitting at the window watching what was\ngoing on in the courtyard below. The two thieves were walk-\ning about with their wives and children, kissing them from\ntime to time, and looking so happy as they warmed themselves\nat the flame of love that their misfortunes had only served to\nfan.\n\nMy own loneliness weighed heavily upon me, I cursed my\nfate. I thought it unjust because I had forgotten that my crime\nfar exceeded theirs in baseness.\n\nThe postman arrived with a letter from my wife. It was\ncold and frigid. My success had wounded her and she pre-\ntended to base her scepticism on the opinion of a professional\nchemist. She added her advice on the perils of illusions that\nmight lead to a mental breakdown. For that matter, what did\nI expect to gain by all this? Could I support a family by my\nchemistry?\n\nThe same alternatives again\u2014love or knowledge. I did not\nhesitate, I struck her down with a final letter of farewell, and\nfelt as pleased with myself as a murderer who has dealt his\nblow successfully.\n\nIn the evening I took a walk in that gloomy part of the\n", "30 INFERNO\n\ncity. I crossed the Canal St Martin, black as a grave, a most\nsuitable place for drowning oneself in. I stopped at the corner\nof the Rue Alibert. Why Alibert? Who was he? Wasn\u2019t the\ngraphite that the analytical chemist had found in my sample of\nsulphur called Alibert graphite? What did that imply? It was\nodd, but I could not rid my mind of the impression that there\nwas something inexplicable about this. Next the Rue Dieu.\nWhy God, when the Republic has abolished him and is de-\nvoting the Panth\u00e9on to a new purpose? Rue Beaurepaire. The\ndelightful retreat of malefactors! Rue de Bondy. Was I being\nled by the Devil? I gave up reading the names of the streets, got\nlost, retraced my steps, but still could not find my way, and\nfinally recoiled before an enormous shed that stank of raw\nmeat and mouldy vegetables, especially sauerkraut. Suspicious-\nlooking persons brushed past me, shouting out coarse words\nas they did so. Fear of the unknown gripped me. I turned first\nto the right, then to the left, and stumbled into a sordid blind\nalley that seemed to be the abode of human trash, vice, and\ncrime. Prostitutes barred my way, street arabs jeered at me.\nThe scene from the night of the Christmas party was repeated.\nVae soli! Who was it who was setting these ambushes for me\nthe instant I detached myself from the world and from people?\nThere was someone who had caused me to fall into this trap.\nWhere was he to be found, that I might wrestle with him?\n\nAs I started to run, rain and slushy snow fell. In the back-\nground, at the end of a short street, I saw outlined against the\nsky a dark archway, an enormous, cyclopean structure. There\nwas no palace behind, only a sea of light. I asked a policeman\nwhere I was.\n\n\u201cAt the Porte Saint-Martin, monsieur.\u2019\n\nA few steps more and I was out in the great boulevards and\nwalking along them. It was a quarter past six by the theatre\nclock. Absinth time, and my friends would be waiting as usual\nat the Caf\u00e9 Napolitain. Quickening my pace, I pressed on, for-\ngetting the hospital, my grief, and my poverty. But outside the\nCaf\u00e9 du Cardinal I happened to bump against a table at which\na gentleman was sitting. I knew him only by name, but he\nFEPAGHITAN 110. SAT 1 orinetant Hie eee han Aall sae be\n", "THE HAND OF THE UNSEEN 31\nwas thinking: \u201cYou here? So you are not in hospital after all!\nFine humbug, that appeal for help!\u2019\n\nI was sure that this man must be one of my unknown\nbenefactors, one of those who had given me alms, and I\nrealized that to him I was a beggar who had no right to go to\ncaf\u00e9s. A beggar! Just the right word. It kept ringing in my\nears, and drove a burning flush to my checks, a flush of shame,\nmortification, and rage.\n\nTo think that only six weeks before I had sat at this same\ntable with the director of the theatre where my play was being\nperformed. I had been his host and he had addressed me as\n\u201cdear Master\u2019. Reporters had tumbled over one another to\ninterview me; photographers had begged for the honour of\nselling my portrait. And now, a beggar, a branded man, an\noutcast from society.\n\nWhipped, played out, hunted to death, I slunk along the\nboulevards like a night-bird and crept back to my hole among\nthe pest-ridden. There I shut myself into my room. This was\nnow my home.\n\nWhen I reflect upon my fate I can see the hand of the Un-\nseen at work, disciplining me, driving me on towards a goal\nthat I myself was still unable to discern. He had granted me\nglory and at the same time He had denied me worldly honours.\nHe had humbled me and simultaneously He had raised me up.\nHe had made me grovel in the dust in order to exhalt me.\n\nThe idea again occurred to me that Providence must have\nsome mission which it intended me to carry out in this world,\nand that this was the beginning of my education for it.\n\nI left the hospital in February, not cured of my illness, but\nproof against the temptations of the world. At our parting I\nhad wanted to kiss the hand of our kind mother who, without\npreaching at me, had taught me the way to the Cross, but I\nhad been held back by a feeling of veneration for something\nthat must not be defiled.\n\nMay her spirit receive this tribute of gratitude from a\nstranger who had gone astray and who now dwells concealed\nin a distant land!\n", "2\nSaint Louis Introduces Me to the\nChemist Orfila\n\nI PURSUED my chemical investigations throughout the winter\nin a modestly furnished house I had rented. I stopped at home\nall day, but in the evening I went out to eat my dinner at a\ncr\u00e9merie, where artists of various nationalities had formed a\nclub. After my dinner I usually visited the family whose house\nI had once quitted in a fit of puritanism. Their home was a\nmeeting place for the whole circle of artist-anarchists, and I\nfelt that I was doomed to endure there all the things I should\nhave preferred not to see or hear: free and easy manners, loose\nmorals, deliberate godlessness. There was much talent among\nthem and infinite wit. Only one of them was a genius, a wild\nfellow, who has since made a great name for himself\n\nNevertheless, it was a family circle. They loved me there\nand I was indebted to them, so I shut my eyes and closed my\nears to their little private affairs, which were no concern of\nmine.\n\nIf it had really been unjustifiable pride that had made me\nshun these people my punishment would have been logical,\nbut as my aloofness had arisen from my efforts to purify my\nindividuality and refine my spirit by contemplation in solitude,\nI find it difficult to understand the workings of Providence in\nthis matter. I am by nature flexible and very willing to adapt\nmyself to my surroundings, out of pure affability and the fear\nof appearing ungrateful; so, as I was excluded from society by\nmy pitiable and scandalous poverty, I was thankful to find\n\n1 Gauguin.\n32\n", "THE CHEMIST ORFILA 33\nsome place of refuge in the long winter evenings, even though\nthe very free tone of the conversation there cut me to the quick.\n\nAfter it had been revealed to me that an unseen Hand was\nguiding my steps along this rough path I no longer felt alone.\nI kept strict watch over my actions and my words, though in\nthis I sometimes failed. But as soon as I sinned I was instantly\ncaught, and the punishment administered wasso punctual andso\nexactly suited to the crime that it left no room for doubts about\nthe intervention of a Power who chastised in order to reform.\n\nI felt that I was personally acquainted with this unknown\nPower. I talked to him, I thanked him, I asked his advice.\nSometimes I imagined him to be my servant, the counterpart\nof Socrates\u2019s daimon, and the consciousness that I could count\non his assistance restored to me an energy and a feeling of\nconfidence that spurred me on to exertions of which I had not\nthought myself capable.\n\nLooked upon by society as a bankrupt, I was born again in\nanother world where no one could follow me. Things that\nwould previously have lacked significance now attracted my\nattention. The dreams I had at night assumed the guise of pro-\nphecies. I thought of myself as one of the dead, passing my\nlife in another sphere.\n\nI had already demonstrated the presence of carbon in sul-\nphur. Analogy would suggest that hydrogen and oxygen were\nthere too, but this I had still to prove. I spent two months\nmaking calculations and studying problems, but I lacked the\napparatus for carrying out experiments. A friend advised me\nto go to the research laboratory at the Sorbonne to which even\nforeigners have access. But I was too timid and too frightened\nof crowds to dare to take such a step, so my work came to a\nstandstill and a brief period of rest ensued. One beautiful spring\nmorning I got up in a good mood, walked down the Rue de\nla Grande Chaumi\u00e9re and reached the Rue de Fleurus, which\nleads to the Luxembourg Gardens. The lovely little street lay\nbefore me perfectly quiet, its wide avenue of chestnuts a\nbrilliant green and straight as a racecourse, with David\u2019s\n\nCc\n", "34 INFERNO\n\ncolumn like a winning post at the far end. In the distance the\ndome of the Panth\u00e9on towered above everything else, while\nthe golden cross that crowned it was almost lost in the clouds.\n\nI stood still, entranced by this symbolic sight, but when I\nat last lowered my gaze I became aware of a dye-house sign\non my right, in the Rue Fleurus. Ha! here I saw something un-\ndeniably real. Painted on the window of the shop were my own\ninitials, A.S., poised on a silvery-white cloud and surmounted\nby a rainbow. Omen accipio. The words of Genesis came into\nmy mind:\n\n\u2018I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of\na covenant between me and the earth.\u2019\n\nIno longer trod upon the ground, I floated through the air,\nand it was with winged footsteps that I entered the gardens,\nwhere there was not a soul about. At this early hour of the\nmorning the place was mine. The rose-garden was mine. I\nrecognized all my friends in the borders, the daisies, the\nverbenas, and the begonias.\n\nAfter making my way along the course I reached the win-\nning post and passed out through the iron gateway into the\nRue Soufflot, turned towards the Boulevard Saint-Michel,\nand stopped beside the stall of second-hand books outside\nBlanchard\u2019s shop. Without thinking what I was doing, I\npicked up an old chemistry book by Orfila, opened it at\nrandom and read: \u2018Sulphur has been included among the\nelements. Nevertheless, the ingenious experiments made by\nH. Davy and the younger Berthollet seem to prove that it\ncontains hydrogen, oxygen, and some special base which no\none has so far succeeded in isolating.\u2019\n\nYou may imagine the feeling of almost religious ecstasy\nthat gripped me when confronted by this seemingly miracu-\nlous revelation. Davy and Berthollet had demonstrated the\npresence of oxygen and hydrogen, I of carbon. It had fallen to\nme therefore to provide the formula for sulphur.\n\nA few days later I was enrolled as a student in the Faculty\nof Natural Sciences at the Sorbonne (St Louis\u2019 Sorbonne!)\nwith the right to work in the research laboratory there.\n", "THE CHEMIST ORFILA 35\n\nThe morning on which I betook myself to the Sorbonne\nwas for me a holy day. Although I had no illusions about the\npossibility of convincing the professors there, who had re-\nceived me with the chilly politeness accorded to foreigners who\npush themselves in, I yet experienced a calm joy, from which\nI derived the sort of courage a martyr must possess when he\ntakes up the struggle against a multitude of enemies\u2014because,\nof course, for me at my age, the young were my natural\nenemies.\n\nWhen I arrived at the open space in front of the little\nchurch that is part of the Sorbonne I found the door open and\nwent in, without really knowing why I did so. The Holy\nMother and Child greeted me with a gentle smile. The figure\non the cross, incomprehensible as always, left me cold.\n\nMy new acquaintance, St Louis, friend of all those smitten\nby poverty and disease, caused some young theological\nstudents to introduce themselves to me.

My dishonourable\nwish was instantly granted.\n\nAn English lady, a sculptress, came to dine at the cr\u00e9merie.\nShe addressed me first and I was immediately attracted to her.\nShe was charming, beautiful, distinguished looking, tastefully\ndressed, with the easy-going manners of the artist, which made\nher seductive into the bargain. In a word, she was a de-luxe\nedition of my wife, her very image, but nobler and on a larger\nscale,\n\nIntending to do mea kindness, the well-known painter who\nwas the doyen of our dining circle invited this English lady to\nthe Thursday soir\u00e9es that he held in his studio.

I was a beggar, I had unful-\nfilled obligations to my wife and child, and yet I had been\nquite ready to commence a relationship which would have\nbeen compromising for an honourable woman. It was nothing\nless than a crime, and I imposed upon myself the appropriate\npenance.

One day, after I had flung an article on\none method of making synthetic iodine into Le Temps, I was\nvisited at my hotel by an unknown gentleman. He introduced\nhimself as the representative of all the iodine manufacturers in\nEurope, said he had just read my article, and promised that, the\nmoment the business side of the matter was concluded, we\nshould be able to bring about a financial crisis on the stock\nmarket, which would result in a gain of millions for us, if we\nhad first taken out a patent.\n\nThe answer I gave him was that my invention was not in-\ntended for industry. It was merely a scientific discovery which\nwas still incomplete, and I was not sufficiently interested in the\nbusiness side of the matter to feel impelled to turn my hand\nto developing its practical use.\n\nHe departed.

Then a telegram arrived\nfrom him, saying that an assistant chemist in the Medical\nFaculty and a Deputy\u2014a man who had already made a name\nfor himself and has since become altogether too notorious\u2014\nwere interested in the iodine question.\n\nI then began a series of methodical laboratory experiments\nwhich invariably produced the same results.

Money came to me of\nitself. I was able to buy books, natural-history specimens, and,\namong other things, a microscope that unveiled for me the\nsecrets of life.\n\nLost to the world by renouncing the empty pleasures of\nParis, I lived entirely within my own quarter of the city. Each\nmorning I visited the departed in the Cemetery of Mont-\nparnasse, and afterwards walked down to the Luxembourg\nGardens to say good morning to my flowers. Now and then\nsome countryman of mine, on a visit to Paris, would call and\ninvite me out to luncheon or to the theatre on the other side of\nthe river. I always refused, as the right bank was forbidden\nterritory. To me it represented the \u2018world\u2019 in the true sense of\nthe word, the world of the living and of earthly vanity.\n\nThe fact was that a kind of religion had developed in me,\nthough I was quite unable to formulate it. It was a spiritual\nstate rather than an opinion founded upon theories, a hotch-\npotch of impressions that were far from being condensed into\nthoughts.\n\nIhad bought a Roman missal, and this I read and meditated\nover. The Old Testament comforted but also chastised me in\na somewhat confused way, while the New Testament left me\ncold. This did not prevent a Buddhist work from making a far\ngreater impression on me than all other sacred books, as it put\nthe value of actual suffering far higher than that of mere\n\n42\n", "PARADISE REGAINED 43\nabstention. Buddha had had the courage to give up his wife and\nchildren when he was in the prime of life and enjoying the\nhappiness of married bliss, whereas Christ had avoided all con-\ntact with the legitimate pleasures of this world.\n\nIn other respects I did not brood upon the emotions that\npossessed me. I remained detached, let things take their course,\nand granted to myself the same freedom that I was bound to\naccord to others.\n\nThe great event in Paris that season was the call to arms\nraised by the critic Brunetitre about the bankruptcy of science.\nI had been well acquainted with the natural sciences since my\nchildhood and had tended towards Darwinism. But I had dis-\ncovered how unsatisfying can be the scientific approach that\nrecognizes the exquisite mechanism of the world but denies the\nexistence of a mechanic. The weakness of the theory was re-\nvealed by the universal degeneration of science, which had\nmarked out for itself a boundary line beyond which no one\nwas allowed to go:\n\n\u201cWe have solved all problems, the Universe has no secrets\nleft.\u2019\n\nThis presumptuous lie had annoyed me even in 1880, and\nfor the past fifteen years I had been engaged upon revising the\nnatural sciences. Thus, in 1884, I had cast doubts upon the\naccepted theory of the composition of the atmosphere, and\nupon the identification of the nitrogen found in air with that\nobtained by breaking down a compound of nitrogen. In 1891\nI had gone to the Laboratory of Physical Science in Lund to\ncompare the spectra of these two kinds of nitrogen, which I\nknew differed. Need I describe the sort of reception I got from\nthe mechanistic men of science there? But with the year 1895\ncame the discovery of argon, which proved the rightness of the\nsuppositions I had already advanced and infused new lifeinto the\ninvestigations that had been interrupted by my rash marriage.\n\nNo, science had not gone bankrupt, only science that was\nout of date and distorted.

In my book Antibarbarus I had dis-\ncussed the psychology of sulphur and interpreted it in the light\nof its ontogeny\u2014that is to say, the embryonic development of\nsulphur.\n\nFor further information I refer those interested to my book\nSylva Sylvarum, published in 1896, in which, proudly aware\nof my clairvoyant faculty, I penetrated to the very heart of the\nsecrets of creation, especially those of the animal and vegetable\nkingdoms.

For this reason I gave my friends to understand\nthat I intended to settle down at Meudon, as I wanted to write\na book for which I required solitude and quiet. Just about this\ntime disagreements on perfectly insignificant matters led to a\nbreach with my circle at the cr\u00e9merie, so that one fine day I\nfound myself completely isolated. This first resulted in an\nastonishing increase in my awareness, a feeling of psychic\npower that demanded some outward manifestation. I felt that\nI possessed boundless vitality and, inspired by selfconceit, I\nhit upon the mad idea of trying to work miracles.\n\nAt an earlier period in my life, and at times of great crises,\nI had noticed that I was able, even at a distance, to exercise an\ninfluence on absent friends. A study of folklore makes it quite\nclear that in bygone days people were much occupied by such\nproblems as telepathy and bewitchment. I do not want to be\ntoo hard on myself, still less do I want to make myself out\ninnocent of nefarious practices, but I do really think that the\ncrushing reversal of fortune I sustained was out of all propor-\ntion to the ill I had intended.\n\nAn unwholesome curiosity, an outburst of perverted affec-\ntion, the result of my horrible loneliness, filled me with a\npassionate desire to try to re-establish contact with my wife\nand child, for I loved them both.

Shaped like a heart, and\nno bigger than a pear pip, it lies between the two seed-lobes,\nwhich also closely resemble a human heart. Imagine my\nemotion when, on the slide, I saw two tiny hands, white as\nalabaster, raised and clasped as if in prayer. Was it a vision? A\nhallucination? Not at all! It was a startling reality that filled\nme with horror. The hands did not move, they were stretched\nout towards me, I could count on each five fingers, the thumbs\nshorter than the rest. They were exactly like the hands of a\nwoman or a child.\n\nA friend, who surprised me in the act of gazing at this over-\nwhelming sight, was invited to look for himself to verify the\ntruth of what I had seen, and he did not require clairvoyance\nto enable him to see the two hands clasped in an appeal to the\nbeholder.\n\nWhat was the meaning of this?

I became aware that the displeasure of\nthe Powers was lying heavy upon me. The hand of the Unseen\nwas raised against me and its blows rained thick and fast upon\nmy head.\n\nFirst of all, my anonymous friend, the man who up to then\nhad provided me with the means of existence, took offence at\na presumptuous letter and withdrew his support. So there I\nwas, left without any resources.\n\nThen, when I received the proofs of my book Sylva\nSylvarum, 1 discovered that the pages were put together exactly\nlike a pack of well-shuffled playing cards. Not only were they\nmuddled and wrongly numbered, but even the different\nsections of the book were jumbled together higgledy-piggledy,\nso that, ironically enough, they symbolized the theory of \u2018the\ngreat disorder\u2019 that prevails in Nature. At last, after endless de-\nlay and protraction, the booklet was printed, but then I was\npresented by the printer with a bill for more than twice the\nsum agreed upon. Very reluctantly I took my microscope, my\nevening clothes, and the few other valuables I still possessed to\na pawnbroker, but at least my book had appeared in print and\nfor the first time in my life I felt that I had said something new,\nimportant and splendid. You may easily imagine how insolent\nand self-assured I felt as I carried the copies to the post.

She asserted, very\npolitely for that matter, that she had heard nothing, but she\npromised to get rid of anyone at all who dared to disturb me,\nfor she was exceedingly anxious to keep me at her hotel, which\nwas not going particularly well.\n\nThough I put no faith in the word of a woman, it was to\nher own advantage to treat me well and I trusted to that.\n\nBut the row continued.

Their muffled hostility was\nshown by the hints they dropped and the sidelong glances they\ngave me. Sick of the struggle, I left both the hotel and the\ncr\u00e9merie, robbed of my belongings, forced to leave my books\nand other small treasures behind me, naked as a little John the\nBaptist. The 21st of February 1896 saw my entry into the\nHotel Orfila.\n", "6\nPurgatory\nTue Hotel Orfila, which looked like a monastery, was in fact\na boarding house for students of the Roman Catholic per-\nsuasion. It was supervised by an abb\u00e9, a gentle, kindly man.\nSilence, order, and good habits were the rule there and, a\nthing that was particularly comforting to me after so many\nvexations, women were not admitted.\n\nIt was an old house with low rooms, dim corridors, and a\nlabyrinth of winding wooden staircases. The whole building,\nthat had exercised such an attraction upon me for so long, had\nabout it an atmosphere of mysticism. My room looked out on\na blind alley in such a way that when I stood in the centre of\nthe floor all I could see was a moss-covered wall, in which\nwere two small circular windows. But when I sat at my table\nby the window I could gaze out over a charming and quite\nunexpected view. An ivy-clad wall enclosed the courtyard of a\nconvent, a boarding school for young women. In it grew plane\ntrees, Paulownias, and Robinias. There was also an exquisite\nGothic chapel. Further off were high walls with innumerable\nlittle barred windows that made me think of a monastery.\nStill further up the valley, a forest of chimneys topping ancient,\nhalf&hidden houses, and in the distance the tower of Notre-\nDame-des-Champs with its cross and, on top of that, the cock.\n\nIn my room were two pictures, an etching of St Vincent\nde Paul and, above my bed in the recess, one of St Peter,\nkeeper of the gates of Heaven.

Furthermore, I learned by\ninquiry that the two bull\u2019s-eyes right opposite belonged to\nsimilar closets. Before very long I found out that the hundreds\nof small windows in the background indicated the presence of\nhundreds of closets placed behind a whole row of dwelling\nhouses. At first I was furious, but, as I had no means of extri-\ncating myself, I had to make the best of it\u2014but how I cursed\nmy fate.\n\nAt one o'clock the waiter brought my lunch and, as I re-\nfused to disturb the things on my desk, he put the tray on the\nbedside commode in which the chamber pot was kept. I com-\nmented on this and the lad excused himself by saying that there\nwas no other table available. He looked a pleasant fellow and\nnot at ail ill-intentioned; so I forgave him, but I made him take\naway the pot.\n\nIf at that time I had known anything about Swedenborg I\nshould have realized that the Powers had condemned me to\nthe Hell of Excrement.\n\nAt first I was infuriated by the persistent bad luck that had\ndogged my footsteps for so many years, but by degrees I grew\ncalmer and gloomily resigned myself to my fate. For edifying\nreading I turned to the Book of Job, convinced that the Eternal\nhad delivered me into the hands of Satan in order to test me.\nThis thought gave me comfort and I rejoiced in my sufferings,\nbelieving that they testified to the confidence the Almighty\nplaced in me.\n\nFrom this time on there occurred a series of manifestations\nwhich I cannot account for, except by assuming the interven-\ntion of unknown Powers, and I began to make notes which\nmounted up by degrees to form a diary. It is extracts from this\nthat I am now making public.\n\nPeople had become icily silent about my chemical investi-\ngations. In order to reinstate myself and to strike a decisive\nblow, I attacked the problem of how to make gold. I took as\n", "PURGATORY 51\nmy point of departure the following question: Why does sul-\nplate of iron in a solution of chloroaurate of sodium precipitate\nmetallic gold? The answer came out as follows: Because iron\nand sulphur are included in the composition of gold. In fact,\nall the compounds of sulphur with iron that occur in Nature\ncontain some gold, more or less. Consequently I began to work\nupon solutions of ferric sulphate.\n\nOne morning I woke up with a vague feeling that I should\nlike to make an expedition into the country. This was entirely\nagainst my inclinations and usual habits, and it was almost by\nchance that I arrived at the Gare Montparnasse and took a\ntrain to Meudon. I got off at the little place itself, which I had\nnever visited before, walked up the main street, and took a\nturning to the right up an alley that ran between two walls.\nTwenty feet ahead, half buried in the ground, I beheld a\nRoman knight, wearing iron-grey armour. The figure was\nbeautifully modelled on a small scale, but I was not misled\ninto thinking that it was in fact anything more than an un-\nworked stone. When I got closer I could see that the thing was\nan optical delusion, but I stopped in front of it, intentionally\nholding fast to the illusion because it pleased me. The knight\nwas looking at the wall close by and, following the direction\nof his gaze, I saw an inscription written in charcoal on the\nwhitewash. The intertwined letters F and S made me think of\nthe initials of my wife\u2019s name. She loves me still! A second\nlater a light dawned upon me when the inscription decom-\nposed. before my eyes into the chemical symbols for iron and\nsulphur (Fe and S) and revealed to me the secret of gold.\n\nI then turned to examine the ground and found two lead\nseals fastened together by twine. One was stamped with the\nletters V.P., the other with a royal crown. I was in no mood\nto analyse in detail what had happened to me here, but I\nreturned to Paris with the very vivid impression that something\nmiraculous had taken place.\n\nIn my stove I burned a sort of coal that is called \u2018sparrows\u2019\nheads\u2019! because it is round and smooth.

A cock\u2019s head with a\nsplendid comb, the trunk almost like a human body with dis-\ntorted limbs, it looked just like one of the demons that used to\nperform in the witches\u2019 sabbaths of the Middle Ages.\n\nThe next day I got out a capital group of two gnomes in\nbillowing garments embracing each other, a masterpiece of\nprimitive sculpture.\n\nOn the third day there was a Madonna and Child in the\nbyzantine style, incomparably beautiful in form.\n\nAfter I had made drawings of them I left all three lying on\nmy table. One of my friends, a painter, came to see me, and,\nafter examining the statuettes with increasing curiosity, he\nasked, \u201cWho has made them?\u201d\n\nMade them? In order to test him I mentioned the name of\na Norwegian sculptor.\n\n\u2018Really,\u2019 he said. \u2018I should have been inclined to guess that\nit was Kittelsen, the famous illustrator of the Norwegian\nfairy-tales.\u2019\n\nI did not really believe in the existence of demons but I was\ncurious to see what impression my bits of sculpture would\nmake on the sparrows who were accustomed to having crumbs\ngiven to them outside my window, so I set the figures out on\nthe roof.\n\nThe sparrows were alarmed and kept away. So there was a\nresemblance that even these little creatures could detect, and\nthere was some reality behind this interplay of inert matter\nand of fire.\n\nThe sun warmed my little figures and the demon with the\ncock\u2019s comb split in two. That reminded me of a bit of folk-\nlore which tells how the dwarfs are struck dead if they stay\nout until sunrise.\n\nDisquieting things happened in the hotel. The day after my\narrival I found, on the board in the vestibule upon which the\nkeys of the rooms were hung, a letter addressed to a Mr X, a\nstudent whose name was the same as my wife's. The stamp\nbore the postmark Dornach, the name of the Austrian village\n", "PURGATORY 533\nwhere my wife and child were living. This was mysterious, as\nI was quite certain that Dornach had no post office.\n\nThis letter, displayed in a way that was obviously intended\nto attract attention, was followed by several more. The next\none was addressed to Dr Bitter and postmarked Vienna. A\nthird bore an assumed Polish name, Schmulachowsky.\n\nClearly the Devil now had a finger in the pie, for that name\nwas pure fabrication. I realized where my thoughts were being\ndirected, namely to one of my mortal enemies who lived in\nBerlin.\n\nYet another that arrived had on it a Swedish name that\nreminded me of an enemy in my native land. Finally came a\nletter posted in Vienna, on which was printed the name ot\nDr Eder\u2019s firm of analytical chemists. In fact, someone was\nspying on my synthesis of gold.\n\nI had no doubts left. This was a plot, but the Devil himself\nmust have shufHled the cards forthe tricksters. No ordinary mortal\ncould have hit on the idea of sending my suspicions roaming to\nthe four quarters of the globe; it was altogether too contrived.\n\nWhen I asked the waiter to tell me about Mr X he artlessly\nreplied that he was an Alsatian. I could get nothing more out\nof him. Once, when I returned from my morning walk, there\nwas a card in the rack just by my key. For one moment I was\ntempted to solve the riddle by having a look at it, but my good\nangel immobilized my hand at the very instant that a young\nman appeared from his hiding place behind the door.\n\nI looked at his face. He was like my wife. We bowed to\neach other without uttering a word, and walked off in opposite\ndirections.\n\nI have never been able to get to the bottom of this plot\nand still do not know who the conspirators were, as my wife\nhas neither brothers nor male cousins.\n\nThis state of suspense and the perpetual threat of vengeance\nwas torment and enough for halfa year. I bore this, like every-\nthing else, as a punishment for sins known and unknown.\n\nThe New Year brought a stranger to our circle at the\ncr\u00e9merie. A painter, an Amcrican, he arrived just at the right\n", "54 INFERNO\n\nmoment to infuse new life into our society, which was growing\nlanguid. A lively, cosmopolitan, daring fellow, with a winning\nmanner, yet he filled me with a vague feeling of mistrust. In\nspite of his assured manner, I knew instinctively that his affairs\nwere in a bad way.\n\nThe crash came sooner than I had expected. One evening\nthe unhappy man came into my room and asked if he might\nstay there a while. He looked like a lost man, as indeed he\nwas.\n\nHe had been driven out of his studio by his landlord and\ndeserted by his mistress. He was up to the ears in debt and\nharassed by duns. He was being abused in the streets by the\nsouteneurs of female models who had not been paid. But the\nthing that had crushed him completely was that his cruel land-\nlord had confiscated the picture which he had been intending\nto exhibit in the Champs de Mars, and which he had been\ncertain would be a success, as the subject seemed to him both\noriginal and vigorous. It represented an emancipated woman,\npregnant, crucified, and mocked by the mob.\n\nHe owed money at the cr\u00e9merie too and found himself\nthrown out on the streets on an empty stomach.\n\nAfter pouring out this first confession he made a clean\nbreast of everything and admitted that he had taken a double\ndose of morphia but that death did not want him yet.\n\nAfter we had discussed the matter thoroughly we agreed\nthat he must move to some other part of the city, that the two\nof us would eat our dinner at a small cook-shop unknown to\nthe others, so that lack of companionship should not deprive\nhim of the courage to prepare another picture for the Salon\ndes Ind\u00e9pendants.\n\nThe sufferings of this man, who became my sole com-\npanion, enhanced my own as I submerged myself in his\nanguish, This was a piece of bravado on my part, but through\nit I acquired a very valuable experience. He revealed to me the\nwhole of his past life. A German by birth, he had lived for\nseven years in America owing to some family misfortune, and\nalso because he himself, in a fit of youthful indiscretion, had\n", "PURGATORY 55\npublished a blasphemous pamphlet, for which sentence had\nbeen passed on him.\n\nI discovered that he was unusually intelligent, of a melan-\ncholy disposition, and an unbridled sensualist. But behind\nthese human characteristics, whose more peculiar features had\nbeen rounded off by a cosmopolitan upbringing, I detected\nsomething that I found disturbing, something that I expected\nto discover fully sooner or later.\n\nI waited for two months, during which time I so merged\nmy own existence in that of the stranger that I had to suffer\nonce again all the hardships of an artist who has not arrived.\nI forgot that my own career was already made, that I was a\nsomebody, that my name was well known in dramatic circles\nin Paris and appeared in Tout Paris,t though this was a matter\nof no consequence to Strindberg the chemist. Moreover, so\nlong as I managed to hold my tongue about my successes, my\ncompanion loved me, but whenever I was obliged to touch\nupon them he was hurt, and looked so unhappy and brow-\nbeaten that, out of pure compassion, I never spoke of myself\nexcept as an old wreck. Thus by imperceptible degrees I was\nhumbled, while he, who had the future before him, recovered\nat my expense. I was like a corpse that lies buried beneath the\nroots of a tree which flourishes by sucking nourishment from\nthe decomposing remains.\n\nThe study of Buddhist writings, that I was making at this\ntime, provided me with a reason for admiring my act of self\ndenial in sacrificing myself for another. A good deed brings\nits reward, and mine was as follows.\n\nOne day in the Revue des Revues I found a portrait of the\nAmerican seer and faith-healer Frances Schlatter, who in 1895\ncured 5,000 sick and then disappeared, never to be seen again.\nI noticed that this person\u2019s features bore a striking resemblance\nto those of my companion. I wanted to get this confirmed, so\nI took the periodical with me to the Caf\u00e9 de Versailles, where\na Swedish sculptor was awaiting me. He too was struck by the\nlikeness and pointed out how extraordinarily similar were\nsome of their circumstances. Both were of German extraction\n\n1 Tout Paris, the name of a directory of important persons.\n", "56 INFERNO\n\nand had been active in America. Schlatter\u2019s disappearance coin-\ncided with our friend\u2019s appearance on the scene in Paris. As I\nhad by then become slightly familiar with the terminology of\noccultism, I hinted at the possibility that this Francis Schlatter\nmight be our man\u2019s \u2018Doppelganger\u2019, who existed independently\nof him and without his knowledge.\n\nWhen I uttered the word \u2018Doppelganger\u2019 my sculptor\nopened his eyes very wide and drew my attention to the fact\nthat our man always had two abodes, one on the right bank of\nthe Seine, the other on the left. I learned, furthermore, that my\nmysterious friend lived a double life. After having spent the\nevening with me absorbed in a discussion of philosophical and\nreligious matters, he was always to be seen late at night at\nBullier\u2019s dance saloon.\n\nWe had one trustworthy means of proving the identity\nbetween these Doppelganger, as a facsimile of Francis Schlatter\u2019s\nlast letter was reproduced in the periodical.\n\n\u201cCome and dine with me this evening,\u2019 I suggested. \u201cThen\nI will get him to write down Schlatter\u2019s letter from dictation.\nIf the handwriting is the same in both cases, in particular the\nsignatures, that ought to be sufficient proof.\u2019\n\nAt dinner that evening everything was confirmed. The\nhandwriting was the same, the signature, the flourish that was\nappended, it was all there.\n\nOur painter submitted to our examination with some\nsurprise. When it was over he asked:\n\n\u201cWhat is it you are aiming at?\u201d\n\n\u2018Do you know Francis Schlatter?\u201d\n\n\u2018T never heard of him.\u2019\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t you remember the faith-healer in America last\nyear?\u201d\n\n\u2018Why, yes, I do remember now. The man was a charlatan!\u2019\n\nHe remembered. I showed him the portrait and the\nfacsimile. He just laughed and his face remained sceptical,\nunmoved, and completely indifferent.\n\nSome days later, just as my mysterious friend and I were\nsitting calmly drinking our absinth outside the Caf\u00e9 de Ver-\n", "PURGATORY 57\nsailles, a man dressed like a workman, and with a malignant\nexpression of countenance, stopped in front of our table and,\nwithout any sort of warning, began to create a disturbance\nright in the middle of the other customers. Confronting my\ncompanion, he shouted at the top of his voice:\n\n\u2018T\u2019ve caught you at last, have I, you damned rogue! What\ndo you mean by ordering a cross from me for thirty francs\nand letting me deliver it and then slinking off? You blackguard,\ndo you think a cross makes itself?\u201d\n\nHe went on like this for an eternity and when the waiters\ntried to remove him he threatened to call the police. All this\ntime his wretched debtor sat motionless, dumb, annihilated,\nlike a condemned man, disgraced in front of that gathering of\nartists, with all of whom he was more or less acquainted.\n\nWhen this exhibition was over I was left in a state of be-\nwilderment, much as if I had witnessed a witches\u2019 sabbath, and\nI asked:\n\n\u201cA cross? A cross for thirty francs? I don\u2019t understand what\nit is all about.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, it was for Joan of Arc\u2019s cross, the contraption I was\npainting from, you know, the thing in my picture of the\ncrucified woman.\u2019\n\n\u2018But he was the Devil himself, that workman.\u2019 And, after\na minute or two\u2019s silence I continued:\n\n\u2018It is odd to be sure, but the Cross is not a thing to trifle\nwith, nor is Joan of Arc.\u2019\n\n\u2018Do you believe that?\u201d\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t know what I believe now.\nBut the thirty pieces of silver?\u2019\n\n\u2018That\u2019s enough, that\u2019s enough,\u2019 he cried out, much upset.\n\nWhen Iarrived at our cook-shop on Good Friday I found my\ncompanion in misfortune fast asleep at the table. Overcome\nby merriment, I woke him up and asked in a voice of surprise:\n\n\u201cYou here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if I am?\u201d\n\n\u2018Oh, as it is Good Friday I thought you would be hanging\non the cross, at least until six o\u2019clock.\u2019\n", "58 INFERNO\n\n\u2018Until six o\u2019clock!

We had been meeting constantly for\nfour horrible months, during which time my companion had\nundergone a re-education, had had time to change his style of\npainting, and had come so far that he was quite contemptuous\nof his Crucified Woman, which he now regarded as worthless\nrubbish. He had learned to take suffering in his stride, as a\nbitter drink, but the only health-bringing one in this life; and\nupon this had followed resignation. His powers of endurance\nwere heroic. I thought he was wonderful when in one single\nday he walked the distance between Montrouge and the Halles\ntwice, there and back on down-at-heel shoes and without\nhaving tasted a morsel of food. By the evening, after making\nseventeen calls on editors of various illustrated papers, he had\nmanaged to place three drawings, but still without ready\nmoney, and after having had only a couple of sous\u2019 worth of\nbread to eat he had gone off to dance at the Bal Bullier.\n\nIn the end we arrived at an unspoken understanding that\nwe should dissolve this association for mutual aid. We both\nhad an odd feeling that we had had enough of each other, and\nthat each must go his own way towards the accomplishment\nof his destiny, and I knew on the last occasion of our saying\ngoodbye that we were parting for ever.\n\nI have never seen this man again, nor have I heard what\nbecame of him.\n\nIn the spring, just at the time when I was so much op-\npressed by my own reverses as well as those of my companion,\nThad a letter from the children of my first marriage, telling me\nthat they had been seriously ill and had had to go to hospital.\nWhen I compared the date they mentioned with the date of\nmy experiment in bewitchment I was seized with horror.

I am only asking the\nreader to bear these facts in mind, should he ever be tempted\nto practise magic, particularly the kind known as bewitchment,\nor witchcraft in the true sense of the word. De Rochas! has\nshown this to be a reality.\n\nOne Sunday morning close upon Easter I woke up, went\nto the Luxembourg Gardens, walked through them, crossed\nthe road, and entered the arcades of the Od\u00e9on Th\u00e9atre. Here\nI came to a stop in front of a row of Balzac\u2019s novels bound in\nblue, picked up his S\u00e9raphita, quite by chance. But why? Maybe\nit was because of some half-submerged memory left on my\nmind by a review of my book Sylva Sylvarum in L\u2019 Initiation,\nin which I had been referred to as a compatriot of Swedenborg.\n\nWhen I got home I opened the book, which was practically\nunknown to me, as so many years had passed since I first read\nit. Now, with a mind prepared to receive it, I devoured the\ncontents of this remarkable work as if it were something en-\ntirely new. In my homeland and his Swedenborg was regarded\nasacharlatan, a madman witha distorted and lewd imagination. I\nhad never read a wordhe had written, and I was now carried away\nby admiration for this angelic giant of the last century, inter-\npreted as he was here by the most profound of French geniuses.\n\nI read on with devout attention until I reached page sixteen,\non which the date of Swedenborg\u2019s death was given. It was\nMarch 20th. I paused, reflected, looked at the calendar. Sure\nenough, the day was March 29th and it was Palm Sunday too.\n\nSo it was that Swedenborg came into my life, in which he\nhas played an immense part. He came on the actual anniversary\nof his death, bringing me the palms of victory or of martyr-\ndom, who could say which?\n\nS\u00e9raphita became my gospel. It caused me to renew my\nties with the beyond to such an extent that life filled me with\nrepugnance and Heaven drew me to it, so that I yearned for it\nwith the irresistible yearning one has for home. I doubted not\n\n1 L\u2019Ext\u00e9riorisation de la sensibilit\u00e9.\n", "60 INFERNO\n\nthat I was already prepared for a higher existence. I despised\nthe earth, this unclean world, man and all his works. I saw in\nmyself the righteous man upon whom the Eternal has visited\ntemptations, but whom the purgatory of this earthly life would\nmake worthy of imminent deliverance.\n\nThis arrogance, called into existence by the intimacy I had\nestablished with the Powers, went on growing, all the more so\nbecause my labours in the field of learning were going well.\n\nAccording to my own calculations, which agreed with the\nobservations made by the metallurgists, I had succeeded in\nmaking gold, and I was confident I could prove it. I sent a\nsample to a chemist in Rouen, with whom I was on a friendly\nfooting. He replied refuting my contentions. For a week I had\nno answer to give him. But, turning over the pages of the book\non chemistry by my protector and patron Orfila, I found there\nthe secret of my method of procedure.\n\nThis old chemical treatise of 1830, forgotten and despised,\nhelped me at a critical moment and became my oracle. My\nfriends Orfila and Swedenborg protected, encouraged, and\nchastised me. I could not see them, but I was aware of their\npresence. They never appeared to me either as spirits or in\nvisions, but I was made conscious of their intervention in the\nvicissitudes of my life by small, daily happenings.\n\nSpirits have become positivists, in harmony with the times,\nand are therefore no longer content to manifest themselves\nonly in visions.\n\nWhat follows ought to be sufficient proof of this, as it\ncannot possibly be explained by the word \u2018coincidence\u2019.\n\nAfter I had succeeded in producing specks of gold on paper\nI tried to obtain the same result on a larger scale by the dry\nprocess and by heat. Two hundred experiments were made\nwithout result and in despair I laid aside my blowpipe. A\nmorning walk led me to the Avenue de I\u2019 Observatoire, where\nI often go to admire the group representing The Four Conti-\nnents for a private reason, namely that the most pleasing of\nCarpeaux\u2019s female figures resembles my wife. She stands under\nPisces beneath the celestial globe and sparrows have built their\nnests behind her back.\n", "PURGATORY 61\n\nAt the foot of the monument I caught sight of two oval\npieces of cardboard. On one was stamped the number 207 and\non the other 28. The meaning: Lead (atomic weight 207) and\nSilicon (atomic weight 28). I picked up my find and put it\namong my chemical notes.\n\nWhen I got home I started a series of experiments with\nlead, but let the silicon wait for further instructions.\n\nMetallurgy had taught me that lead, refined in a melting\npot lined with bone-ash, always yields a little silver and that\nthis silver invariably contains a minute quantity of gold. From\nthis I concluded that, as calcium phosphate consitutes the most\nimportant part of bone-ash, it should be the essential factor in\nthe production of gold from lead.\n\nThis proved to be true. Lead, melted on a bed of calcium\nphosphate, always turned golden yellow on the underside.\nBut the Powers showed their disfavour by interrupting the\nexperiment before it was completed.\n\nA year later, when I was living in Lund in Sweden, a\nsculptor, who was working on the production of fine pottery,\ngave me a glaze composed of lead and silicon, from which I\nwas able, by treating it over heat, to extract for the first time\nbeautiful and absolutely perfect metallic gold.\n\nWhen thanking him, I showed him the two bits of card-\nboard stamped with the numbers 207 and 28. Can one in such\na case as this talk of chance or coincidence when it so clearly\nbears the mark of an unshakable logic?\n\nI repeat again, I was never haunted by visions, but that does\nnot mean that actual objects did not assume human shape,\noften with magnificent effect.\n\nFor instance, I once found my pillow, which I had\ncrumpled when taking my midday rest, so moulded that it\nlooked like a marble head in the style of Michelangelo.

There\u2019s a school of\ndrawing, if you like!\u2019\n\nThe more we looked at it the more lifelike and frighten-\ningly real the manifestation became.\n\n\u2018Clearly the spirits have taken to realism just as we human\nartists have.\u2019\n\nThese occurrences could not be regarded as accidental, for\non some days the pillow presented the appearance of horrible\nmonsters, of gothic gargoyles, of dragons, and one night, when\nI had been out merrymaking, I was greeted by the Evil One\nhimself, the Devil Incarnate in mediaeval style, goat\u2019s head and\nall. These things never frightened me, they all seemed so\nnatural, but there was implanted in my mind an impression\nthat something unusual, quasi-supernatural, was going on.\n\nMy friend the sculptor, whom I called in to witness these\nphenomena, showed no surprise but asked me to accompany\nhim to his studio.

My life was ebbing away, old\nage was creeping on. Wife, child, and hearth of my own, all\nwas wrecked. Autumn within, spring without!\n\nThe Book of Job and the Lamentations of Jeremiah brought\nme comfort, for between my fate and Job\u2019s there was assuredly\nsome analogy, at least. Was not I, too, afflicted by incurable\nulcers? Had not poverty fallen heavily upon me, and my\nfriends deserted me?\n\n\u2018I go mourning without the sun.\n\nIam a brother to jackals\n\nAnd a companion to ostriches.\n\nMy skin is black and falleth from me,\n\nAnd my bones are burned with heat.\n\nTherefore is my harp turned to mourning\n\nAnd my pipe into the voice of them that weep.\u2019\nSo said Job. And Jeremiah expressed in three words the depths\nof misery into which I had sunk:\n\n\u2018I forgot prosperity.\u2019\n\nIt was in this frame of mind, one sultry evening as I sat bent\nover my work, that I heard the sound of a piano coming from\nbehind the foliage in the valley beneath my window. I pricked\nup my ears like a charger at the blast ofa trumpet. I straightened\nmy back, drew a deep breath, my whole self metamorpho-\nsized. It was Schumann\u2019s Aufschwung. And what was more, I\nwas sure that it was he who was playing it.

He had come from Berlin to Paris to\nkill me, just as he had killed me in Berlin, and for what reason?\nBecause Fate had decreed that the woman who was now his\nwife had been my mistress before he had known her? Was it\nmy fault that things had happened that way? Of course not,\nbut nevertheless he had conceived a deadly hatred for me,\nslandered me, prevented me from having my plays accepted\nat the theatres, woven intrigues that had bereft me of the re-\nmuneration I needed in order to exist. In a fit of rage I had\nstruck him a brutal, a cowardly, blow, so cowardly that I\nregretted it as much as if I had assassinated him.\n\nNow the fact that he had come here to kill me was a relief,\nfor death alone could deliver me from remorse.\n\nIt must have been he who had annoyed me by sending all\nthose letters with faked addresses that I had found in the\nporter\u2019s lodge. \u2018Good,\u2019 thought I, \u2018let the blow fall. I shall not\ndefend myself, for he is in the right and life means nothing to\nme. -\n\nHe was for ever playing Aufschwung as only he could play\nit. Invisible behind that wall of greenery, he sent the enchanted\nstrains soaring over the blossoming creepers, so that I fancied\nI could see them fluttering like butterflies in the sunshine.\n\nWhy was he playing? Was it to let me know of his arrival\nwith the object of terrifying me and pursuing me as I fled?\n\nPerhaps they would know at the cr\u00e9merie, where the other\nRussians had long been predicting the arrival of their fellow\ncountryman. I went to dine there that very evening, but was\nmet at the door by hostile looks. The whole assembly, already\ninformed of my quarrel with the Russian, were now in league\nagainst me. I decided to disarm them by firing the first shot.\n\n\u2018Popoffsky? is in Paris, isn\u2019t he?\u2019 I asked challengingly.\n\n\u2018No, not yet,\u2019 replied one of them.\n\n\u2018But he is,\u2019 asserted another. \u201cHe has been seen at the office\nof the editor of the Mercure de France.\u2019\n\nThis was denied by some of the others, and the discussion\nended leaving me knowing as little as before, but pretending\n\n1 Popoffsky = Stanislav Przybyszewski, Polish author, 1868-1927.\n", "PURGATORY 67\nto believe all that I had been told. Their all too obvious hos-\ntility made me swear to shun the place in future. I did so with\nregret, as there were people there with whom I got on very\nwell. Isolated once more, driven out by this accursed enemy\nof mine, I became resentful, hatred stung me and poisoned my\nmind. I renounced the idea of dying. I was not going to be\nbeaten by someone who was inferior to me. It would be far\ntoo great a humiliation for me, and far too great an honour\nfor him. I would accept the challenge. I would defend myself.\nIn order to ascertain the true facts, I went to the Rue de la\nSant\u00e9, behind the Val-de-Grace, to seek out a Danish painter!\nwho was an intimate friend of Popoftsky. This man, who had\nonce been my friend too, had come to Paris six weeks\npreviously, and when I had met him in the street had greeted\nme like a stranger, almost like an enemy. He had called on\nme the next day and, possibly with the idea of varnishing over\nthe bad impression he had made, invited me to his studio and\nsaid all kinds of polite things to me. They were, however, so\nexaggerated that they left me with the feeling that he was a\nfalse friend. When I asked him if he had heard from Popoffsky\nhe became very reserved and evasive, but did confirm the\nreport that Popoffsky was expected shortly in Paris.\n\n\u2018To murder me,\u2019 I put in.\n\n\u201cOf course. Be on your guard!\u2019\n\nOn the morning on which I returned his visit I opened the\ndoor only to find a gigantic Danish mastiff, a monstrous object,\nlying on the paving stones of the courtyard, blocking my way\n\u2014just by chance, of course. Instinctively, and without a\nmoment\u2019s doubt or hesitation, I turned back into the street and\nretraced my steps, perfectly certain that I had escaped some un-\nknown danger and thanking the Powers for having warned\nme of it. Some days later, when I was trying to repeat the\nvisit, a child was sitting on the threshold of the open doorway,\nholding a playing card in its hand. A flash of superstitious in-\nsight prompted me to glance at the card. It was a ten of spades!\n\n\u2018They are up to no good here,\u2019 thought I, and retreated\nwithout putting a foot inside.\n\n1 Edvard Munch, actually a Norwegian.\n", "68 INFERNO\n\nThat evening I was absolutely determined, after what had\nhappened at the cr\u00e9merie, to defy both Cerberus and the ten\nof spades. But Fate had ordained otherwise, as I came upon the\nman I was looking for at the Brasserie des Lilas. He was\ndelighted to see me and we sat down together at a table\noutside.\n\nAs we refreshed our memories of the times we had had\ntogether in Berlin, he warmed up and resumed his old r\u00e9le of\nintimate friend; minor matters of discord between us were\nforgotten, and he even admitted that a number of the things\nhe had denied in public were in fact true. Then suddenly he\nseemed to recollect some duty he had to perform or some\npromise he had given, and fell silent. His manner became cold\nand hostile, as if he were annoyed that he had been enticed\ninto betraying secrets.\n\nWhen I asked him point blank if Popoffsky was in Paris he\nreplied with such an abrupt \u2018No\u2019 that I was sure it was a lie,\nand we parted.\n\nIt is worth while pointing out that this Dane had been\nMme Popoffsky\u2019s lover before I was, and bore me a grudge\nbecause his mistress had deserted him for me. Now he was\nplaying the part of friend of the family, thanks to Popoffsky\u2019s\nlack of taste; for the latter knew very well what his wife\u2019s\nrelationship to \u2018handsome Henrik\u2019 had been.\n\nThe strains of Schumann\u2019s Aufschwung resounded over the\nbosky tree-tops, but the player remained invisible and I could\nnot discover his whereabouts. He played every afternoon\nbetween four and five for a whole month.\n\nOne morning, after I had walked down the Rue de Fleurus\nto comfort myself by having a look at my rainbow in the\npaint-shop window, I entered the Luxembourg Gardens, now\nin full bloom and lovely as a fairy-tale. There on the ground\nI found two dry twigs, broken off by the wind. They were\nshaped like the Greek letters for P and y.

Absinth at six o\u2019clock\noutside the Brasserie des Lilas, just behind the statue of Marshal\nNey, is now my only vice and my last remaining pleasure.\nWhen the day\u2019s work is done, and body and soul are worn\nout, I restore myself with a glass of the green liquor, a cigarette,\nand Le Temps or Le Journal des D\u00e9bats. How sweet life can still\nbe when the misery of one\u2019s existence is blurred by slight in-\ntoxication. Probably the Powers grudge me this one moment\nof blissful make-believe between the hours of six and seven,\nsince from this very evening my felicity has been disturbed by\na series of unpleasant incidents which I am not disposed to\nascribe purely to chance.\n\nFor instance, on this 17th of May I found the spot that I\nhave occupied for two years already taken.

My absinth was\nbefore me, mixed to perfection; my cigarette was lit, Le Temps\nopened, when, looking up, I saw a drunken man passing by, a\ndisgusting, a horrible, sight. He fastened his eyes on me with a\nsly, mocking expression that embarrassed me. His face was the\ncolour of wine dregs, his nose Prussian blue, his eyes evil.

Though surrounded\nby these boisterous and insolent persons, I was determined not\nto budge. Then followed a scene which must, without any\ndoubt, have been arranged by the skilful hand of the Unseen,\nfor it was far too cleverly contrived for it to be possible for\nme to suppose a plot on the part of the persons concerned, to\nwhom I was completely unknown.\n\nOne of the young men laid a sou on my table with a\ngesture that I could not understand.

As he had forgotten his overcoat I put mine over his\nshoulders. That soothed him immediately. He became most\namenable, I could do what I liked with him. He did not dare\nto oppose me and we were in complete agreement on all\npoints. He admitted that Popoffsky was a scoundrel, and that\nit was he I had to thank for all my reverses. Then, suddenly,\nhe had a nervous seizure, he began to shake like a medium\nunder the influence of a hypnotist, he fidgeted, shook off my\novercoat, stopped eating, threw down his fork, got up, gave\nme back my coat, and said goodbye.\n\nWhat could be the meaning of this?

The table\nwas placed between the rubbish-bin and the conveniences.\nOver the rubbish-bin was the picture of the crucified woman\nby my former friend the American, hung there as a revenge\nbecause he had gone off without paying what he owed. Near\nthe table the Russians had set up a statuette of a warrior armed\nwith a sickle, their national emblem. To scare me, of course.\nA young gutter-snipe, who lives in the house, went to the\ncloset at my rear with the evident intention of annoying me.\nThat yard is as narrow as a well and the sun cannot reach it\nbecause of the high walls. The cocottes, who have taken up\nresidence here and there on every storey above the yard, had\nopened their windows and were raining indecent remarks\nupon our heads. Servants came out with buckets and emptied\ngarbage into the rubbish-bin. It was Hell let loose. As for my\ntwo table companions, they were known perverts and carried\non a disgusting conversation for the purpose of trying to\nengage me in a quarrel.\n\nWhat was I doing there? The fact is that loneliness had\ncompelled me to seek the company of other human beings, to\nlisten to the sound of the human voice.\n\nThen, just as my state of spiritual torment reached its peak,\nI caught sight of some pansies that were blooming in the\nnarrow flower-bed. They shook their heads at me as if they\nwanted to make me aware that some danger was threatening\nme, and one of them, whose face was like a child\u2019s, signalled\nto me with her large, deep, shining eyes:\n\n\u2018Leave this place!\u2019\n", "PURGATORY 79\n\nI got up and paid my bill. As I was leaving, the gutter-\nsnipe bade me a surly farewell, using some opprobrious\nepithet that nauseated me but did not make me lose my\ntemper.\n\nI commiserated with myself and blushed for the others.\n\nI absolved them on the ground that they were merely\ndemons performing their duty.\n\nNevertheless, it was only too obvious that I had displeased\nProvidence and when I got back to my room I began to\nscrutinize my debit and credit accounts. Up to now, and in\nthis had lain my strength, I had found it impossible to admit\nthat others could be in the right. Now, broken as I was by the\nhand of the Unseen, I tried to confess that I myself was in the\nwrong. When I examined my conduct of the last few weeks I\nwas seized with dread. My conscience had no mercy but\nstripped me naked.\n\nI had sinned out of arrogance, hubris, the one vice that the\nGods do not forgive. The friendship that Dr Papus had shown\nme and the praise he had bestowed on my investigations had\nso much encouraged me that I had persuaded myself that I had\nsolved the riddle of the Sphinx. I had set myself up as a second\nOrpheus; Nature had died at the hands of the learned, and it\nwas my task to bring her back to life.\n\nThad been so conscious of the protection of the Powers and\nhad flattered myself that my enemies could not get the better\nof me; this had gone so far that I had scorned the notion of\nshowing even the most elementary humility.\n\nI think this is a suitable place in which to insert the story of\nthe mysterious friend! who played such a decisive part in my\nlife as my mentor. He gave me advice, comfort, and chastise-\nment; and, in the periods of acute poverty that recurred from\ntime to time, he it was who stood by me and provided me\nwith the means of subsistence,\n\nAs early as 1890 he had written to me about a book I had\npublished. He had found that on some points my ideas agreed\nwith those of the theosophists, and he asked me to give him\nmy views on occultism and on that priestess of Isis, Mme\n\n1 Torsten Hedlund, Swedish theosophist and publisher.\n", "80 INFERNO\n\nBlavatsky. The rather presumptuous tone of his letter dis-\npleased me, and I told him so point-blank in my reply. Four\nyears later I published Antibarbarus, and at this critical moment\nof my life I received another letter from this unknown man,\na letter that struck an elevated, almost prophetic, note. In it he\nforetold for me a future that would be rich in suffering and in\nhonour. Into the bargain he gave me his motive for renewing\nour correspondence. This arose from a presentiment he had\nthat I was at that moment passing through a spiritual crisis and\nthat a word of comfort was perhaps necessary. Finally he\noffered me material assistance; but this I refused, as I was\njealous of my independence, however wretched it might be.\n\nIn the autumn of 1895 it was I who wrote to him, to ask\nhim to assist me by publishing my articles on natural history.\nFrom that day we have kept up by letter very friendly and\neven intimate relations, except for one brief rupture occasioned\nby some hurtful expressions of which he made use when he\ntook it upon himself to instruct me upon things I already knew\nor lectured me in a highfalutin\u2019 way for my lack of modesty.\n\nMeanwhile, after our reconciliation, I communicated to\nhim all my observations and was more free with my confi-\ndences than was wise. To this man, whom I had never seen, I\nconfessed everything. From him I put up with the most severe\nreproofs, because in him I saw an idea rather than a person.\nHe was a messenger from Providence, a Paraclete.\n\nThere were two fundamental differences of opinion be-\ntween us, which led to very animated arguments, though these\nnever degenerated into bitterness or quarrelling. As a theoso-\nphist he preached the doctrine of Karma\u2014that is to say, the\nsum total of human destinies which counter-balance one an-\nother, so as to result in a kind of Nemesis. He was in fact a\nmechanist and an epigone of the so-called materialistic school.\nI, on the other hand, saw the Powers as one or a number of\nconcrete, living, individualized personalities who directed the\ncourse of events and the lives of human beings, consciously and\nhypostatically, as the theologians would put it. Our second\ndifference of opinion concerned the denial and mortification\nof the Ego, which to me seemed and still seems an insane idea.\n", "PURGATORY 81\n\nAll that I know, little as that may be, springs from one\ncentral point, my Ego. It is not the cult but the cultivation of\nthis which seems to me to be the supreme and final goal of\nexistence. My answer to his objections was always given in the\nsame decisive form: to kill the Ego is to commit suicide.\n\nFor that matter, to whom shall I submit? To the theoso-\nphists? Never. Before the Eternal, the Powers, and Providence\nI do try to curb my bad impulses always and every day, as far as\nis possible. To strive for the preservation of my Ego in the teeth\nof all the influences that a domineering sect or party may try to\nimpose upon me, that is my duty, dictated by the conscience\nI have acquired through the grace of my divine protectors.\n\nBecause of qualities that I loved and admired in this man\nwhom I had never seen, I put up with the censorious tone he\nadopted when he was treating me as an inferior being. I always\nanswered his communications and never concealed my aversion\nfor theosophy.\n\nAt last, just in the middle of the Popoffsky affair, he ad-\ndressed me in such haughty language that his tyranny became\nintolerable. I feared he regarded me as insane. He called me\n\u201cSimon Magus\u2019, a practitioner of black magic, and he advised\nme to read Mme Blavatsky. I retorted by giving him to under-\nstand that I had no need of Mme B, and that no one could teach\nme anything. Thereupon he threatened me, with what do you\nthink? He said that he would see to it that I was set upon the\nright path once more, and this with the assistance of Powers\nthat were stronger than those I acknowledged. I then begged\nhim not to interfere with my destiny, so well guarded by the\nhand of that Providence which had always guided me. In order\nto make my faith plainer to him by an example, I told him the\nfollowing story, a detail from my life-history, which has been so\nrich in providential happenings. At the same time I warned him\nthat I dreaded giving away my secret, as I had a misgiving that I\nmight, byso doing, bring upon myselfthe vengeance of Nemesis.\n\nIt happened ten years ago, at the most tumultuous period\nof my career as an author. I was attacking the feminist move-\nment, which was supported by everyone in Scandinavia except\n\nF\n", "82 INFERNO\n\nmyself, I had allowed myself to be carried away by the heat of\nthe moment and so far overstepped the limits of decency that\nmy fellow countrymen regarded me as insane.\n\nI was living in Bavaria with my first wife and our children\nwhen I received a letter from a friend! I had known since my\nyouth, inviting me to spend a year with him, me and the\nchildren. My wife was not mentioned.\n\nMy suspicions were aroused by this letter, partly because\nof its affected style and partly because of the erasures and\ncorrections, which revealed the hesitation the writer had felt\nin the choice of arguments to advance. I scented a trap, and\nrejected his proposal in vague but grateful terms.\n\nTwo years passed; the divorce from my first wife was an\naccomplished fact, and I wrote to my friend inviting just my-\nself to stay with him on the island, in the outer skerries of the\nBaltic, where he functioned as an Inspector of Customs.\n\nHe received me warmly, but there was an atmosphere of\nfalsehood and equivocation, and he spoke to me with the air\nof a police inspector. After a night\u2019s reflection the whole\nposition became clear to me. I had wounded this man\u2019s self-\nconceit by something I had said in one of my novels and, in\nspite of the sympathy he otherwise felt for me, he bore me a\ngrudge. He was exceedingly despotic by nature, and now he\nwanted to tamper with my destiny, to tame my spirit, to sub-\ndue me in order to demonstrate his superiority.\n\nHe was anything but careful of his choice of the means he\nemployed. He tortured me for a week, poisoned my mind\nwith slanders and lies that he invented for the purpose, but he\ndid it so clumsily that I remained convinced that the trap he\nhad set for me on the previous occasion had been laid with\nthe object of getting me shut up as insane.\n\nI let him have his own way without opposition, trusting\nthat my lucky star would deliver me when the time was ripe.\n\nMy apparent submissiveness caused my tormentor to grow\nfond of me. Isolated from the world on his island out in the\nocean, he was disliked by his neighbours and subordinates and\nat last yielded to his desire for a confidant.

This\ntime I learned that his brother was shut up somewhere in the\ncountry because he was insane.\n\nI asked myself whether it was for this reason, and because\nhe wanted to be revenged on Fate, that he was aiming at\ngetting me shut up too.\n\nMeanwhile I heartily commiserated with him about his\nfamily misfortunes and won him over completely, so that I\nwas able to leave the island and rent a house on another in the\nvicinity, where I had my own people with me. After I had\nbeen there a month I was recalled to my \u2018friend\u2019 by a letter,\nand found him shattered by the news that his brother had\nbattered in his own head in a manic fit. | comforted him, my\ntormentor, and then, to crown it all, his wife confided in me,\nweeping as she did so, that she had long been expecting her\nhusband sooner or later to fall a victim to the same fate that\nhad overtaken his brother and sister.\n\nA year later I read in the papers that my friend\u2019s elder\nbrother had taken his life in circumstances that indicated\nmental derangement. So three thunderbolts had fallen on the\nhead of this man who had tried to play with lightning.\n\nYou may well say what an extraordinary coincidence!\nAnd, more than that, what a fatality there is in this coinci-\ndence, so that every time I have told this story I have been\npunished for it.\n\nThe intense heat of July descended upon Paris and life\nbecame unendurable. Everything stank, most of all the\nhundred conveniences.\n\nI was expecting a catastrophe, though I could not say\nwhat.\n\nIn one street I found a piece of paper on which was written\nthe word Marten, in another street a similar piece on which the\nword Vulture was written by the same hand.

He, as a shameless murderer, is capable of\nanything if he could poison his wife and children.\n\nI had been reading the lovely little pamphlet The Delight\nof Dying and it had made me long to leave this world. To\nreconnoitre the borderland between life and death I would lie\ndown on my bed, uncork a bottle of cyanide of potassium, and\nallow its deadly fumes to escape into the room. He would\ndraw near, that old Reaper, so mild and so seductive, but at the\nlast moment someone always appeared or something always\nhappened to cut me short. The waiter would enter on some\nerrand, a wasp would fly in at the window.\n\nThe Powers refused me this one and only happiness, and\nI bowed to their will.\n\nAt the beginning of July all the students left for their\nholidays and the hotel was unoccupied. My curiosity was\ntherefore aroused by the arrival of a stranger, who was put into\nthe room adjacent to my writing desk. This unknown man\nnever uttered a word; he seemed to be occupied in writing\nsomething behind the wooden partition that separated us. All\nthe same, it was odd that he should push back his chair every\ntime I moved mine. He repeated my every movement in a way\nthat suggested that he wanted to annoy me by imitating me.\n\nThis went on for three days. On the fourth I made the\nfollowing observation. When I went to bed the man in the\nroom next to my desk went to bed too, but in the room on the\nother side, next to my bed. As I lay in my bed I could hear\nhim getting into his on the other side of the wall; I could hear\nhim lying there, stretched out parallel to me. I could hear him\nturning the pages of a book, putting out the lamp, breathing\ndeeply, turning over and falling asleep.\n\nComplete silence then reigned in the room adjacent to my\nwriting desk. This could only mean that he was occupying\nboth rooms. How unpleasant to be besieged on both sides at\nonce!\n\nAlone, absolutely alone, I now had my dinner on a tray in\nmy room and ate so little that the good-natured waiter was\n", "PURGATORY 85\ninconsolable. I did not hear the sound of my own voice for a\nwhole week and I began to lose it for lack of exercise. I had not\na sou in my pocket, no stamps or tobacco either.\n\nI willed myself to make a final effort. I would make gold by\nthe dry method with the aid of fire. Money was procured, a\nfurnace, crucibles, charcoal, bellows, and tongs. The heat was\nintense and, stripped to the waist like a smith, I sweated in\nfront of the open fire. But the sparrows had built a nest in the\nflue and the fumes made their way out into the room. My first\nattempt left me infuriated, partly because I had a headache but\nalso because of the futility of my operations, as everything\nwent wrong. After I had re-melted the stuff three times I\nlooked into the crucible. The borax had formed a skull with\ntwo glistening eyes whose supernatural irony pierced my soul.\n\nStill not a grain of metal, so I gave up further experiment.\n\nSitting in my armchair I read the Bible, opened at random.\n\n\u201cAnd none calleth to mind, neither is there knowledge or\nunderstanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea,\nalso I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted\nflesh and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an\nabomination?

Suppose they were pure folly? Alas!\nif so, I had sacrificed a life of happiness for myself and for my\nwife and child too, all for a chimera.\n\nWoe is me, madman that Iam!

No, the Angel of Light was\nguiding me along the true path towards the Islands of the\nBlessed, and this was the Devil tempting me or I was being\npunished.\n\nI sank down into my armchair. A torpor, such as I have\nseldom experienced, weighed upon my spirit. It seemed to me\nthat a magnetic fluid was proceeding from the partition wall,\nmy limbs were overcome by drowsiness. With a great effort\nI got up and made haste to get into the open air. As I was\nwalking down the corridor I heard two voices whispering in\nthe room adjacent to my desk.\n\nWhy were they whispering? To maintain secrecy, of\ncourse.\n\nI walked down the Rue d\u2019Assas and entered the Luxem-\nbourg Gardens. I could hardly drag myself along. I felt as if\nI were paralysed from my hips to the balls of my feet, and fell\non to a bench behind Adam and his family.\n\nI was poisoned, that was my first thought. Popoffsky had\nkilled his wife and children with poison gas. He must have\narrived. He must have sent a stream of gas through the wall\nas Pettenkofer had done in his famous experiment. What was\nI to do? Go to the police? No, for if there was no proof I\nshould be locked up as insane.\n\nVae soli! Woe to the solitary, a sparrow on a roof! Never\nhad my existence seemed more wretched, and I wept like an\nabandoned child who is scared of the dark.\n\nIn the evening I no longer ventured to sit at my desk for\nfear of a new attempt on my life. I went to bed not daring to\nsleep. Night had come and the lamp was lit. I saw, cast on the\nwall opposite my window, the shadow of a human being,\nwhether man or woman I could not say, but the impression\nI retain is that it was a woman\u2019s.\n\nWhen I got up to look, the blind came clattering down\nwith a bang. After that I heard the unknown person enter the\nroom next to my recess. Then all was silent.\n", "PURGATORY 87\n\nFor three hours I lay awake, unable to get to sleep, a thing\nthat does not usually take me long. An uneasy sensation began\nto creep over me. I was being subjected to an electric current,\npassing between the two rooms on either side of mine. The\ntension increased still more and, in spite of the resistance I put\nup, I was obliged to get out of bed. I had only one thought in\nmy mind:\n\n\u201cSomeone is killing me!

Installed in an\narmchair on the top of the flight of steps leading up to the\nPavilion, I used to sit for hours looking at the flowers in the\ngarden and meditating on past events. The calm that succeeded\nmy flight was a proof that it was no illness that had struck me,\nrather that I had been persecuted by enemies. I worked during\nthe day andslept peacefully atnight. Delivered from the sluttish-\nness of my former surroundings, I became sensible that I was\nbeing rejuvenated by the hollyhocks, those flowers of my youth.\n\nThe Jardin des Plantes, that wonder of Paris unknown\nto the Parisians, had become my private park. The whole\nof Creation was encompassed by its walls, a Noah\u2019s ark, a\nParadise Regained, in which I could saunter without danger,\nthough in the very midst of the wild beasts; my happiness was\ntoo great. Taking the minerals as my starting point, I made my\nway through the vegetable and animal kingdom and came at\nlast to Man, behind whom I found the Creator. The Creator,\nthat great artist who Himself develops as He creates, who makes\nrough drafts only to cast them aside, who takes up abortive\nideas afresh, who perfects and multiplies His primitive con-\nceptions. Most certainly, everything is the work of His hand.\nOften He makes prodigious advances in His invention of\nnew species, and then Science comes along and establishes the\nexistence of gaps, of missing links, and persuades itself that\nthere have been intermediate forms that have now disappeared.\n\nMeanwhile, certain that I was now secure from my\nenemies, I sent my new address to the H\u00e9tel Orfila, so that I\n\n88\n", "INFERNO 89\nmight resume contact with the outside world through my post,\nwhich had not been reaching me since my flight.\n\nHardly had I shed my incognito than my peace was broken.\nThings began to happen that made me uneasy and I was\noppressed by the same disagreeable sensations as before. It all\nbegan when objects whose purpose I could not possibly ex-\nplain were heaped up in the room next to mine on the ground\nfloor. An old gentleman, with evil grey eyes like a bear\u2019s,\ncarried in empty packing cases, sheets of iron, and other objects\nthat I could not identify. At the same time the noises from\nwhich I had suffered in the Rue de la Grande-Chaumi\u00e9re began\nagain above my head. Cables were dragged about, and people\nbanged and hammered exactly as if they were assembling an\ninfernal machine like those of the nihilists.\n\nThen, too, my landlady, who had been extremely obliging\nwhen I first took up residence there, became more formal. She\nspied upon me, and her manner of addressing me was\nannoying.\n\nFurthermore, new lodgers moved into the room on the\nfloor above me. The taciturn old gentleman, whose heavy\nfootfall I knew so well, was no longer there. He was a retired\nman of independent means, who had lived in that house for\nmany years. He had not left it now, no, he had simply moved\nto another room. Why?\n\nThe servant girl, who cleaned my room and served my\nmeals, wore a serious expression and cast surreptitious glances\nat me, full of pity.\n\nIn the room above mine they had set up a wheel that went\nround and round all day. Condemned to death! I was con-\nvinced of it. But by whom? By the Russians? By the devout,\nby the Catholics, the Jesuits, the theosophists? For what reason?\nAs a sorcerer or a practitioner of the black arts? Perhaps it was\nby the police, as an anarchist? That is a charge very commonly\nemployed for getting rid of personal enemies.\n\nEven to the moment at which I write this down I have no\nidea what was going on that July night when death hurled\nitself upon me, but I well know and shall never forget the\nlesson I learned from it, which will last me the rest of my life.\n", "90 INFERNO\n\nIf those who were let into the secret should ever own up\nand confess that what happened was the result of a conspiracy,\nwoven by the hands of men, I shall not bear them a grudge,\nfor Iam now convinced that it was another and mightier hand\nthat set theirs in motion, without their knowing or willing it.\n\nIf, on the other hand, there was no plot, then it must have\nbeen I who, by the power of my own imagination, had created\nthese disciplinary spirits in order to punish myself.\n\nWe shall see from the sequel how improbable this supposi-\ntion is.\n\nOn the morning of my last day I got up with a resignation\nthat I would describe as religious. Nothing bound me to life\nany more. I put my papers in order, wrote the essential letters,\nand burnt all that had to be destroyed.\n\nAfter so doing I went out for a walk in the Jardin des\nPlantes, to bid farewell to Creation.\n\nThe: blocks of lodestone from Sweden that stand in front\nof the Museum of Mineralogy gave me a greeting from my\nnative land.

I could not see him, but I felt\nthat he was there.\n\nMy uneasiness was increased by the visible alterations that\nhad been made in the room next to mine. To begin with, a\nlength of cloth had been stretched across a rope, evidently with\nthe intention of concealing something. On the mantelpiece of\nthe stove were piles of metal plates separated by wooden slats.\nA photograph album, or some other book, had been placed on\ntop of each pile, clearly in order to lend an appearance of\ninnocence to these diabolical machines, which I would des-\ncribe as being like batteries. To crown it all, I caught sight of\ntwo workmen perched on the roof of a house in the Rue\nCensier, exactly opposite the wing in which I lived. What they\nwere doing up there I could not see, but they kept pointing at\nmy French window as they handled objects the nature of which\nI could not make out.\n\nWhy did I not flee? Because I was too proud, and because\nwhat is inevitable must be endured.\n\nI made my preparations for the night. I had a bath and\nmade sure that my feet were spotlessly clean, a thing to which\nI attach great importance, as my mother had taught me when\nI was a child that dirty feet are a disgrace. I shaved and\nsprinkled perfume on the shirt I had bought in Vienna three\nyears earlier for my wedding. . . . A condemned man\u2019s last\ntoilet.\n\nFrom the Bible I read those psalms in which David calls\ndown the vengeance of the Eternal upon his enemies.\n\nBut what of the penitential psalms? No, it would not be\nright for me to repent, for it was not I who had guided my\ndestiny. I had never done evil for its own sake but only in\ndefence of my person. To repent is to criticize Providence,\nwho imposes sin upon us as a form of suffering in order to\npurify us through the disgust engendered in us by a bad deed.\n\nI settled my account with life. We were quits. If I had\n", "92 INFERNO\n\nsinned then, upon my word, I had suffered punishment enough.\nShould I fear Hell? But indeed, I had passed through a thousand\nhells in this life without faltering and endured more than\nenough to awaken in me a passionate desire to leave all the\nvanities and false pleasures of this world that I had always\nabhorred. Born as I was with a longing for Heaven, I had wept,\neven as a child, over the filthiness of existence and had felt my-\nself a stranger to my parents and in the community. Ever since\nmy childhood I had sought God but found the Devil. In my\nboyhood I had borne the Cross of Jesus Christ but I had re-\npudiated a God who was content to rule over slaves cringing\nbefore their tormentors.\n\nAs I was drawing down the blind of my French window\nI noticed a party of ladies and gentlemen who were drink-\ning champagne in the private reception room. Clearly some\ntravellers who had arrived that evening. But they were not\nassembled just for pleasure since they were all looking serious.\nThey were discussing something, making suggestions, speak-\ning in hushed voices as if they were conspirators. The torture\nwas intensified by the fact that they turned round as they sat\nand pointed in the direction of my room.\n\nAt ten o\u2019clock I put out the lamp and fell asleep, as calm\nand resigned as one who was breathing his last.\n\nIawoke. A clock in the house struck two, a door was shut,\nand I was drawn from my bed as if by a vacuum pump that\nwas sucking at my heart.\n\nHardly had my feet touched the floor than a stream of\nelectricity was discharged upon the nape of my neck, pressing\nme to the ground. I struggled up, grabbed my clothes, and tore\nout into the garden, a prey to the most horrible palpitations.\n\nWhen I had got into my clothes my first lucid thought was\nthat I must go to the police and ask to have the place searched.\nBut the main gate was closed, the porter\u2019s lodge too, so I\ngroped my way forward, opened a door on the right, and\nentered the kitchen, where a night-lamp was burning. I upset\nit and was left standing there in inky darkness.\n", "INFERNO 93\n\nTerror brought me to my senses again and, actuated by the\nthought that if I made a mistake I was lost, I went back to my\nroom.\n\nI dragged an armchair into the garden and, sitting there\npoe the starlit sky, I went over in my mind all that had taken\nplace.\n\nAn illness? Impossible. I had been in excellent health up to\nthe time that I shed my incognito. An attempt upon my life?\nYes, for I myself had watched it being prepared. Moreover, I\nfelt completely restored here in the garden, out of reach of my\nenemies, and my heart was functioning perfectly normally.\nWhile in the midst of these reflections I heard someone cough\nin the room next to mine. Instantly from the room above came\na slight, answering cough. Probably signals, and exactly like\nthose I had heard the last night I spent in the H\u00e9tel Orfila. I\nstepped forward and tried to burst open the French window\nof the ground-floor room, but the lock held.\n\nWorn out by a useless struggle against these invisible\nenemies, I sank into the armchair. Sleep took mercy upon me\nand there, under the stars of a lovely summer night, lulled by\nthe whisper of the hollyhocks as they swayed in the gentle\nJuly breeze, I knew no more.\n\nI was woken by the sun and returned thanks to Providence\nfor rescuing me from death. I packed my few belongings and\nprepared to leave for Dieppe, there to seek refuge with friends,\npeople I had neglected as I had everyone else, but who were\nlenient and generous to all hapless and shipwrecked beings.\n\nWhen I asked for the proprietress I was told she could not\nsee me, the excuse being that she was indisposed. It was just\nwhat I should have expected, certain as I was that she was one\nof the accomplices.\n\nAs I took my departure I called downa curse upon the heads\nof the evil-doers and implored Heaven to rain fire upon that\nnest of robbers.

My face was blackened by smoke from the engine,\nmy cheeks sunken, my greying hair damp with sweat, my\neyes haggard, my shirt filthy. I was a miserable sight.\n\nBut when my amiable hostess, who treated me like a sick\nand abandoned child, had left me alone in front of a dressing-\ntable, I examined my face at close quarters. There was some-\nthing about its expression that made me shudder. It was not\nthat it bore the imprint of death or of vice, it was something\nelse. If at that time I had read Swedenborg, the mark that the\nevil spirit had stamped there would have revealed to me the\ntruth about my mental state and the events of the past weeks.\n\nThen I felt ashamed and disgusted at myself. My con-\nscience pricked me for the ingratitude I had shown to a family\nwho had thrown open this harbour of refuge to me before, as\nthey had done to so many other shipwrecked mariners.\n\nThe furies had driven me here to be punished. It was the\nbeautiful home of an artist, a home of happiness, of married\nbliss, enchanting children, luxury and spotless cleanliness, of\nboundless hospitality, liberal and humane views, pervaded by\nan atmosphere of beauty and kind-heartedness that seared my\nsoul. In the midst of all this I felt as dissatisfied with myself as\na damned man would in Paradise, and it was here that I began\nto discover that I was damned.\n\nEvery blessing that life can offer was spread out before my\neyes, every blessing that I had lost.\n\nI was given an attic room with a view towards the top of\nthe hill, where there was an asylum for the elderly.

But, as it happened, when we opened the door\nof a lumber room, an object, quite harmless in itself, made me\nlose heart. It was the skin of a polar bear used as a rug, but its\ngaping jaws, threatening fangs, and sparkling eyes upset me.\nWhy was it we had found that brute there just at this moment?\n\nI lay down on my bed fully dressed, determined to remain\nawake until the fateful stroke of two.\n\nUntil midnight I occupied myself by reading.

All\nthe same, the tension increased and my heart began to beat\nrapidly. I put up a resistance, but in a flash my body was\ncharged with a fluid that suffocated me and drained my\nheart.\n\nI rushed down the stairs and made for the drawing-room,\nwhere a temporary bed had been arranged in case I should\nhave need of it. I lay down on it for five minutes, trying to\ncollect my thoughts. Could it have been radiant electricity?\nNo, the compass had refuted that possibility.

But now\na discharge like a cyclone fell upon me and tore me from my\nbed. The hunt was on once more. I hid behind walls, [lay down\nclose to doorways, in front of fireplaces. Wherever I went, the\nfuries sought me out. Mental agony got the better of me, an\nunreasoning terror of everything and of nothing had me in\nits grip. I fled from room to room, finally taking refuge on the\nbalcony, where I crouched in a heap.\n\nDawn broke with a yellowish-grey light, sepia-coloured\nclouds assumed strange and monstrous shapes which increased\nmy despair. I found my way to my friend the painter\u2019s studio,\nlay down on the carpet, and closed my eyes. After five minutes\nI was awakened by an irritating noise. A mouse was looking\nat me and evidently wanted to come nearer. I shooed it away,\nbut back it came with a second mouse. Good heavens, was I\nsuffering from delirium tremens, I who had not abused wine\nfor the last three years? (The next day I satisfied myself that\nthere really were mice in the studio, so of course it was just a\ncoincidence. But by whom had it been prepared and for what\npurpose?)\n\nI moved again, and this time lay down on the carpet in\nthe lobby. There merciful sleep descended upon my tortured\nsoul and I was unconscious of my sufferings for perhaps half\nan hour.\n\nA clearly articulated \u2018Alp!\u2019 woke me with a start.

Demons at play. This was only a poetic\nee but all the same it may have embraced the whole\ntruth.\n\nI climbed the stairs right up to my attic room.

This comforted me and I sank down on my bed\nmore dead than alive.\n\nOn Sunday the 26th of July the Jardin des Plantes was\ndevastated by a cyclone. Details of the disaster appeared in the\nnewspapers and I found them exceptionally interesting, I\ncannot explain why. It was the day on which Andr\u00e9e\u2019s balloon\nwas going to ascend for the attempt upon the North Pole,\nand the omens were unfavourable. The cyclone had brought\ndown a number of balloons in various places, causing the\ndeath of several aeronauts.

For this reason I was determined to go\nto Sweden, there to seek the help of a friend who was a doctor.t\n\nAs a memento of Dieppe I took with me a bit of rock, a\nkind of iron ore shaped like the trefoil of a Gothic window\nand marked with a Maltese cross. It was given to me by a child,\nwho had found it on the beach. He told me that these stones\nfall from the sky and are washed ashore by the waves.\n\nI was very willing to believe what he told me, and I have\nkept his gift as a talisman though its significance is stilla mystery\nto me.\n\n(After a storm the inhabitants of the coast of Brittany\ncollect stones called staurolites, that are shaped like crosses and\nhave the appearance of gold.)\n\nThe little coast town to which I went is in the extreme\nsouth of Sweden.

The four wings of the building,\none storey high, enclosed a quadrangular courtyard, in the\nmiddle of which stood a dome-shaped building, an imitation\nof Tamburlaine\u2019s grave in Samarkand. The pitch of the roof,\nand the Chinese tiles that covered it, reminded one of the Far\nEast. An apathetic tortoise crawled about on the paving stones,\nor buried itself in the weeds in a state of Nirvana which seemed\nlikely to endure for ever.\n\nA thicket of Bengal roses adorned the outer wall of the\neast wing, in which I lived alone. To reach the two gardens\nbelonging to the house you crossed a yard, a narrow, dark,\ndamp place, which had in it a chestnut tree and some angry\nblack hens.\n\nIn the flower garden was a pagoda-like summer-house,\ncompletely overgrown by clematis.\n\nThis monastery, with its innumerable rooms, was inhabited\nby a single human being, the superintendent of the district\nhospital. A widower, a solitary, he had gone his own inde-\npendent way through the hard school of life, and looked down\non his fellow human beings with the sturdy, noble scorn that\nsprings from a profound knowledge of the relative worthless-\nness of everything, including one\u2019s own self.\n\nThis man\u2019s entrance upon the stage of my life was of such\nan unexpected character that I am tempted to reckon it as a\ntheatrical Deus ex machina.\n\nAt our first meeting after I arrived from Dieppe he looked\nsearchingly at me and exclaimed:\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter with you? Your nerves! Good, but\nthere is something else as well. You have the evil eye, a thing\nI do not remember your having of old. What have you been\nup to? Debauchery or vice? Or have you lost your illusions, or\ntaken to religion? Tell me all about it, old boy.\u2019\n\nBut I could not tell him anything at all, because the first\nidea that took hold of my suspicious mind was that he had been\n", "INFERNO 99\nprejudiced against me in advance. Someone had informed him\nof my condition and I was going to be put away.\n\nI pleaded insomnia, nervousness, nightmares, after which\nwe talked of a number of other matters.\n\nThe doctor installed me in a small flat in his house. My\nattention was immediately attracted to an American bedstead\nof iron, whose four uprights were surmounted by brass knobs\nthat resembled the conductors of an electric machine. In\naddition there was a flexible mattress, the springs of which\nwere made of copper wire, twisted into spirals like those of\na Ruhmkorff induction coil. You may judge of my fury when\nI found myself faced by this piece of devilish bad luck.\n\nIt was quite impossible to ask for another bed, as that\nwould have aroused suspicions about my sanity. To convince\nmyself that nothing was hidden above me, I went up into the\nattic. There, just to make matters worse, I found precisely one\nobject, an enormous coat of chain mail, placed exactly over\nmy bed. \u201cThat is an accumulator,\u2019 thought I. \u2018If a storm breaks,\na thing that very often happens in these parts, the network of\niron will attract the lightning and I shall be lying on the con-\nductor.\u2019 But I did not dare to say a word about it. I was also\nmuch disturbed by what sounded like the steady roar of a\nmachine. As it happened, I had been plagued by a buzzing in\nmy ears ever since I left the H\u00e9tel Orfila, a noise that resembled\nthe pounding of a water-wheel. I was therefore doubtful\nwhether the roaring noise I heard was real or not, and inquired\nabout it.\n\n\u2018The press in the printing house next door.\u2019\n\nThere was a simple and natural explanation for everything,\nbut it was just this simplicity in the means employed that so\nmuch alarmed me and drove me mad.\n\nThen came night with its terrors. The sky was overcast,\nthe air heavy; there was thunder about. I did not dare to go\nto bed and spent two hours writing letters. Annihilated by\nweariness, I undressed and crept between the sheets. An awful\nsilence reigned over the house as I put out the lamp. In the\ngloom I could feel someone watching me, someone who\ntouched me lightly, groped for my heart and sucked.\n", "100 INFERNO\n\nI promptly threw myself out of bed, opened the window,\nand precipitated myself into the courtyard, but the rose bushes\nwere waiting and my shirt was no protection against the lash\nof their thorns. Slashed to bits and bleeding, my naked feet\nflayed by stones, scratched by thistles, stung by nettles and\nslipping all the time on unknown objects, I crossed the court-\nyard and reached the kitchen door that led to the doctor\u2019s\nflat.

So he had\nlied.\n\nMoreover, that very evening he had expatiated upon the\nunfortunate effects that mankind would suffer should it prove\npossible to manufacture gold. Universal bankruptcy, general\nconfusion, anarchy, the end of the world.\n\nThere would be nothing for it but to kill the gold makers.\nThose had been his final words.\n\nThere is another point worth mentioning. My friend\u2019s\neconomic position was a pretty humble one. I had therefore\nbeen astonished to hear him say that he was intending, in the\nimmediate future, to buy the property where he was living.\nHe was in debt, in a very tight corner, yet he was dreaming of\nbecoming a property owner.\n\nEvery circumstance combined to make me suspicious of\nmy good friend.\n\nWas I suffering from persecution mania?

This is much stronger than sulphonal.\u2019\n\nHad my excellent friend had any idea what a fuse he was\nlighting, he would have chosen almost anything else.\n\nThis mythology, in two volumes, comprising about a\nthousand pages in all, had hardly been put into my hand\nbefore it fell open, of itself as it were, and my eyes instantly\nbecame glued to the following lines, which engraved them-\nselves on my memory in letters of fire.\n\n\u201cAccording to the legend, Bhrigu, who had learned every-\nthing from his divine father, became so proud of his knowledge\n", "INFERNO 103\nthat he believed it to surpass that of his master.

And I was in Hell too, hunted\nhere by the Powers.\n\nWho then was my master?

Even the thorns too! This was too\nmuch,\n\nNo doubt about it. I was in Hell. And in truth the facts\ngave such reasonable support to this apparently fanciful idea\nthat at last I really believed it.\n\nThe doctor seemed to me to be torn between the most\nconflicting emotions. At times he was preoccupied, watched\nme furtively, and treated me with humiliating brutality. At\nothers, himself unhappy, he would tend and comfort me as\nhe might have done a sick child. Then again, he would rejoice\nin the power of trampling underfoot a man of importance,\nfor whom he had previously felt respect, and he would play\nthe tormentor and lecture me thus:\n\n\u2018It is your duty to work.

They were quite new and served\nno apparent purpose. He also put two rifles and a revolver in\nhis bedroom, and another collection of axes, too large for any\ndomestic use, out in the corridor. What a devilish piece of bad\nluck that these appurtenances of the hangman and the torturer\nshould have been put where I could not fail to see them. They\nmade me uneasy because they seemed so strange and so\nuseless.\n\nMy nights had become fairly quiet, but the doctor, on the\nother hand, had begun to wander about alarmingly. In the\nmiddle of one very dark night I was awakened by hearing a\ngun go off. I discreetly pretended not to have heard anything,\nbut in the morning he explained the incident by laying the\nblame on a flock of magpies which had flown into the garden\nand disturbed his sleep.\n\nOn another occasion it was the housekeeper who uttered\nsome hoarse shrieks in the small hours. On yet another, the\ndoctor moaned and sighed deeply and called upon the \u2018Lord\nof Hosts\u2019.\n\nWas this a haunted house?

They did not dare to kill me outright, only to\ndrive me mad by underhand methods, so that they could cause\nme to vanish behind the gates of the madhouse.\n\nAppearances now argued even more strongly against the\ndoctor. I discovered that he had developed my gold synthesis,\nso that he knew more about it than I did myself. Into the bar-\ngain what he said one minute he contradicted the next and,\nfaced by his lies, my imagination took the bit between its\nteeth and bolted off beyond the bounds of reason.\n\nOn the 8th of August I took a morning walk outside the\ntown.

I walked on and on, aimlessly. Then I\nbegan to think more clearly, and made straight for the house\nof the Medical Officer of Health for the town. I rang the bell\nand waited, meanwhile trying to decide what I could say\nwithout incriminating my friend.\n\nAt last the doctor appeared. I asked him to excuse this late\nvisit, but I was a sick man, suffering from insomnia and faint-\ning fits, who had lost confidence in his doctor and so forth\u2014\nI said that the excellent friend whose hospitality I had accepted\nhad treated me as a hypochondriac and had refused to listen to\nme.\n\nAlmost as if he had expected that I should come, the doctor\ninvited me to be seated, offered me a cigar and a glass of wine.\n\nIt was a relief to be received like a well-bred man after\nhaving been hounded about like a complete idiot. We sat\nchatting for two hours, and I found out that the doctor was a\ntheosophist to whom I could tell everything without fear of\ncompromising myself.\n\nFinally, a little after midnight, I rose, saying I would try\nto find a room at an hotel, but the doctor advised me to go back\nto my friend.\n\n\u2018Never, he would be likely enough to murder me.\u2019\n\n\u2018But if I come back with you?\u2019\n", "INFERNO 107\n\n\u201cWell, then, we will go together and face the enemy\u2019s\nfire. But I am sure he will never forgive me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe'll go all the same.\u2019\n\nSo we returned the way I had come and, finding the door\nlocked, I banged on it.\n\nAfter a minute my friend opened the door, and it was my\nturn to feel compassion. This man, a surgeon, accustomed to\ninflicting pain on others without showing a trace of pity, this\nprophet of premeditated murder, he looked such a pitiful\nsight. He was wan as a corpse, he trembled and stammered,\nand when he saw the doctor standing behind me he sank to\nthe ground in the grip of a terror which appalled me more\nthan all the horrors that had gone before.\n\nWas it possible that this man had been intending to commit\nmurder and was afraid of exposure? Certainly not! and I\nthrust the impious thought out of my mind.\n\nAfter we had exchanged a few meaningless words, half\njesting on my side, we parted for the night.\n\nThere are times in our lives when things happen so pregnant\nwith horror that our minds refuse to accept them at the moment\nof impact. But the impression they have made is there all the\ntime and very soon returns with irresistible force.\n\nWhen I got home after my nocturnal visit a sight, that for\na fleeting moment had attracted my attention in the doctor\u2019s\ndrawing-room, suddenly came back to my mind.\n\nThe doctor had gone to fetch some wine. Left alone I\nstarted to look at a cupboard with panels inlaid with walnut\nor alder, I forget which. As usual, the grain of the wood\nproduced various shapes. As I looked, I beheld a goat\u2019s head,\nexecuted by a master hand, upon which I instantly turned my\nback. Pan himself! just as the tradition of antiquity had por-\ntrayed him. Pan! whom the Middle Ages had transformed into\nSatan. It was he all right!\n\nI confine myself here to a bare narration of fact. The doctor\nto whom the cupboard belongs would be doing a service to\nthe science of occultism if he would have the panel photo-\ngraphed. Dr Marc Haven in L\u2019Initiation (November 1896)\n", "108 INFERNO\n\ndiscussed these phenomena, which are very common in all the\nrealms of nature. I recommend the reader to examine carefully\nthe face that is drawn on the shell of the crab.\n\nAfter this adventure my friend and I openly declared our\nhostility to each other. He made it plain to me that my pre-\nsence was superfluous. I let him know that I was prepared to\nmove to a hotel while I waited for important letters. He then\npretended to be offended.\n\nAsa matter of fact, I was unable to budge for lack of money,\nand for the rest I had a premonition that a change in my\ndestiny was about to take place.\n\nMy health was now restored. I slept well at night and\nworked during the day. Providence adjourned any further\nexpressions of its displeasure and my endeavours were all\ncrowned with success. If I picked up a book at random in\nthe doctor\u2019s library it was sure to give me just the information\nI needed. For instance, in an old chemistry book I found the\nsecret of the process by which I had been making gold, so that\nI was able, by means of metallurgy, to prove by calculations\nand analogies that I had made gold and that in fact people had\nalways made gold when they thought they had merely ex-\ntracted it from ore.\n\nAn article on the subject was sent off to a French periodical\nand immediately accepted. I hastened to show it to the doctor\nwho, when he could not deny the facts, plainly showed how\nmuch he disliked me.\n\nAfter this I had to admit to myself that he was no longer\nmy friend, since my success gave him pain.\n\nAugust 12th. Bought a sort of notebook from a bookstall.\nSplendidly bound in tooled and gilded leather. My attention\nwas attracted by the design of the tooling, which, strangely\nenough, contained a prophecy. Its interpretation will be given\nin the sequel.

Found a leaf torn from an office calendar in\nthe road. On it was printed in large type August 13th (the\nclock\u2019s date again). Under the date, in small type, the words\n\u201cNever do in secret what you would not do in public\u2019. (Black\nmagic!)\n\nAugust 15th. A letter from my wife. She laments my\nfate, says she still loves me, that our child is with her and\nshe hopes for its sake that matters will improve between us.\nHer relations, who used to hate me, are not insensible to\nmy sufferings and have invited me to visit my daughter\u2014\nthat little angel\u2014who lives in the country with her grand-\nmother.\n\nFor me this was like being recalled to life. My child, my\ndaughter, had supplanted her mother. I longed to embrace the\ninnocent little mite, whom I had actually been prepared to\ninjure. I wanted to beg her to forgive me, to make life happier\nfor her by small, fatherly attentions. I was eager to lavish on\nher all the tenderness I had been hoarding for years. I began to\nfeel like one reborn, as if I were awakening from a long and\nevil dream. I saw in all this the goodwill of that severe Master\nwho had punished me with such a heavy but understanding\nhand. Now I grasped the meaning of those sublime but obscure\nwords from the Book of Job: \u201cBehold, happy is the man whom\nGod correcteth.\u2019\n\nHappy indeed, for about the \u2018others\u2019 he troubles himself\nnot at all.\n\nWhether or not I should find my wife down there by the\nDanube I did not know and it mattered very little to me\nbecause of the indefinable lack of harmony between us.

For me this halfhour journey was like being\ndragged through a hedge of thorns, stabbed to the heart as\nI was by the memories it revived. First I passed through the\nstreet where my friend Popoffsky had lived with his first wife,\nunknown or rather ignored, struggling with passion and\npoverty. Now his wife was dead, his child too\u2014both had died\nin that house on the left\u2014and our friendship had degenerated\ninto ugly hatred.\n\nThere on the right was the ale-house, the meeting place\nof artists and writers and the scene of so many intellectual and\namorous orgies.\n\nOver there was Cantina Italiana, the spot where, three\nyears ago, I used to meet my fianc\u00e9e and where we had con-\nverted my first Italian royalties into chianti.\n\nThere was the Schiff bauerdamm and Pension Fulda, where\nwe had lived together as newly-weds. And here was my theatre,\nmy book-shop, my tailor, and my chemist.\n\nWhat fatal instinct was it that had led my driver to bring\nme through this via dolorosa, paved with buried memories\nwhich at this nocturnal hour rose up like ghosts? I could not\nimagine why he had to drive down this particular alley, past\nthe Black Boar, once our place of refreshment and famous as\nthe favourite haunt of Heine and E. T. A. Hoffmann. Its host\nwas there too, standing outside on the steps under the monster\u2019s\nhead hung out as a signboard. He looked at me, but without\nseeing me.

At the same\ntime I was acutely aware that all this was over and ought to\nremain buried, leaving room for what was to come.\n\nThat night I slept in Berlin and when I awoke in the\nmorning I saw over the roof-tops a roseate flush, carnation\npink, greeting me in the eastern sky. Then I remembered that\nI had seen the self-same colour in Malm\u00e96 on the evening be-\nfore my departure. This Berlin that I was leaving had been my\nsecond fatherland. In it I had lived through my seconda prima-\nvera, which was also to be my last. At the Anhalter Bahnhof\nI left behind me not only my memories but all hope of re-\nnewing a springtime and a love that were never, never to\nreturn again.\n\nAfter spending a night in Tabor, where the roseate flush\nfollowed me, I travelled through the Bohemian Forest down\nto the Danube. Here the railway came to an end, and it was\nby carriage that I made my way into the depths of the country\nthat borders the Danube as far as Grein. My route lay between\napple and pear trees, cornfields and green meadows. At last\nI saw in the distance, on a hill on the other side of the river,\nthe little church that I had never entered, but which had been\nthe most prominent landmark in the view we had had from\nthe cottage where my daughter had been born on that un-\nforgettable May morning two years before. I drove through\nvillages, past castles and monasteries, along a road lined with\ninnumerable penitential chapels, Calvaries, votive offerings,\nmonuments raised to commemorate accidents, thunderbolts,\nor sudden deaths. Most certainly, at the yet distant end of my\npilgrimage, I should find awaiting me Golgotha\u2019s twelve\nstations of the Cross.\n\nEvery hundred yards or so the crucified figure with the\ncrown of thorns saluted me, reinforced my courage, and bade\nme welcome to the Cross and its torments.\n\nTo mortify my flesh I kept telling myself that my wife\nwould not be there, which indeed I already knew. But now\n", "BEATRICE 113\nthat she would not be there to prevent those tempestuous\nfamily rows, I should have to endure reprisals from her elderly\nrelatives. When I had last left their house the circumstances\nhad been so painful that I had refused to bid them goodbye.\nNow I was coming back resigned to the idea of receiving\npunishment in order that I might regain peace, and by the time\nI had passed the last village and the last crucifix I was already\nfeeling in anticipation the torments of a condemned man.\n\nMy daughter had been a baby of six weeks when I left\nher; now she was a little girl of two and a half. At our first\nencounter she studied me with an expression on her face that\nwas serious without being severe, probing my soul to its\ndepths, apparently with the idea of trying to discover whether\nI had come for her sake or for her mother\u2019s. When she felt\nreassured she allowed me to kiss her and put her tiny arms\nround my neck.\n\nIt was like Dr Faustus\u2019s reawakening to an earthly existence,\nbut sweeter and purer. I was never tired of holding the little\none in my arms, of feeling her tiny heart beating against\nmine. When a man loves a child he becomes a woman; he\ncasts off his masculinity and experiences what Swedenborg\ncalls the sexless love of those who dwell in Heaven. This was\nhow I could begin to prepare myself for Heaven. But first of\nall I must expiate my sins.\n\nBriefly the situation was this. My wife was living else-\nwhere with a married sister, as her grandmother, who was in\npossession of all the family property, had sworn that our\nmarriage should be dissolved. The old lady hated me for my\ningratitude, and for other reasons too. I was welcome to see\nthe child, who would never cease to be mine, and could remain\na guest in my mother-in-law\u2019s home for an indefinite period.\nI accepted the situation as I found it, and did so gladly. My\nmother-in-law had forgiven me everything, in the gentle and\nsubmissive spirit of a deeply religious woman.\n\nSeptember rst, 1896.

My poor, poor wife. Is this our punishment for the\ncrime we committed in trifling with love?\n\nA strange thing happened yesterday evening at supper.\nMy little daughter cannot help herself to her food; so, wanting\nto assist her, I touched her hand, quite gently and with the\nkindest intentions. The child gave a shriek, snatched away\nher hand, and darted at me a look that was full of horror.\nWhen her grandmother asked her what was the matter she\nreplied:\n\n\u2018He hurt me.\u2019\n\nI sat there quite taken aback and unable to utter a word.\nI had done much harm intentionally; could I now have come\nto do it without wishing it?\n\nThat night I dreamt that an eagle was pecking my hand to\npunish me for some crime. I knew not what.\n\nThis, morning my daughter came in and greeted me ten-\nderly and with loving caresses. She had coffee with me and\nI let her spend some time at my writing desk, while I showed\nher picture books. We have become really good friends al-\nready, and my mother-in-law is delighted to think she has\nsomeone to help her with the little one\u2019s upbringing. In the\nevening my little angel insisted that I should watch her being\nput to bed and hear her say her prayers. She is a Catholic, and\nwhen she urged me to pray too and to cross myself, I did not\nknow what to say to her, as I am, of course, a Protestant.\n\nOn September 2nd there was a great commotion. My\nmother-in-law\u2019s mother who lives down by the river, a few\nkilometres from here, had issued orders that I was to be sent\naway. She wanted me to leave immediately, and threatened\nto disinherit her daughter if she was not obeyed. My mother-\nin-law\u2019s sister, a most kind-hearted woman, who was herself\ndivorced, invited me to spend some time with her in a neigh-\nbouring village until the storm had blown over. With this in\nmind she came to fetch me. We drove up a two-kilometre-\nlong hill, and when we got to the top we had a view over a\ncircular valley that lay below us, sunk between the surrounding\n", "BEATRICE 115\nmountains. In the valley itself, numberless hills, spiky with\npine trees, rose up like the craters of volcanoes. In the very centre\nof this funnel-shaped valley lay the village and its church and,\nhigh up on a steep rock, the castle, like a mediaeval fortress\nin appearance. Interspersed here and there were cornfields and\nmeadows, watered by a stream that cut its way through the\ngorge beneath the castle.\n\nThe sight of this singular landscape, unique of its kind,\nfilled me with sudden amazement. It struck me that I had seen\nit before, but where, where?\n\nWhy, of course, in that zinc bath in the Hotel Orfila, the\npicture made by the iron oxide. It was the same landscape,\nthere was no doubt about it.\n\nWith this lady, whom I call my aunt, I drove down the\nhill to the village, where she had three rooms in a large\nbuilding, which also housed a bakery, a butcher\u2019s shop, and\na tavern. The house was equipped with a lightning conductor,\nas lightning had set fire to the loft the previous year. When\nmy kind aunt, who is just as pious as her sister, led me into the\nroom she had set aside for me, I halted on the threshold, as\nmuch moved as if I had seen a vision. The walls were painted\npink, the very same pink as the flush of dawn that had haunted\nme on my journey. The curtains too were pink, and the win-\ndows were full of flowers that coloured the light as it entered.\nEverything was exquisitely clean, and the old four-poster bed\nwith its canopy was a couch fit for a virgin. The whole room\nand the manner in which it was furnished was a poem, the\ninspiration of a mind that lived only in part on this earth.\nThere was no crucifix, only a figure of the Blessed Virgin and\na stoup of holy water to keep off evil spirits.\n\nShame seized me. I was afraid of defiling this creation of a\npure soul who had raised this temple to the Holy Mother\nover the tomb of her only love, whom she had buried more\nthan ten years before. In halting phrases I tried to refuse her\nnoble offer, but the kind old lady was obstinate.\n\n\u2018It will do you good to sacrifice your earthly love to the\nlove of God and the tenderness you feel for your child. Be-\nlieve me, this love without thorns will give you peace of heart\n", "116 INFERNO\nand a quiet mind and, under the protection of the Virgin, your\nnights will be tranquil.\u2019\n\nI kissed her hand as a token that I was grateful for the\nsacrifice she was making, and with feelings of compunction,\nof which I had not known myself to be capable, I finally\naccepted her offer, certain that I should be granted a reprieve by\nthe Powers, who seemed to have postponed for the time being\nthe punishments they intended to inflict upon me for my good.\n\nFor some reason or other I reserved myself the right to\nremain one more night in Saxen and put off moving till the\nmorrow. So with my aunt I set off to return to my child, but\nwhen we got outside into the street I observed that the rod\nand wire of the lightning conductor were fixed exactly over\nthe spot where my bed stood.\n\nWhat devilish bad luck! It made me feel sure I was the\nchosen object of persecution.\n\nMoreover, I also noticed that the only view I had from my\nwindow was of the poor-house, inhabited by released criminals\nand sick people, some of them at the point of death. What a\nsorry company and what a gloomy prospect to have before\none\u2019s eyes!\n\nWhen I got back to Saxen I packed my things and prepared\nfor my departure. It pained me to have to part from my\ndaughter, of whom I had grown so fond. My resentment was\naroused by the cruelty of the old woman in dividing me from\nmy wife and child, and in a fit of rage I shook my clenched\nfist at an oil painting of her that hung above my bed. A\nmuttered curse accompanied the gesture.\n\nTwo hours later a frightful thunderstorm broke over the\nvillage, flashes of lightning intersected one another, and rain\npoured down from the murky heavens.\n\nWhen I arrived at Klam the next day my roseate room\nwas all ready for me, but on looking up I saw a cloud, shaped\nlike a dragon, hovering over my aunt\u2019s house. Furthermore,\nI learned that a thunderbolt had set fire to a neighbouring\nvillage and that the cloudburst had ravaged our parish, des-\ntroying haycocks and washing away bridges.\n", "BEATRICE 117\n\n(On September the roth a very remarkable cyclone had\nravaged Paris.

On the subject of this\ncyclone, and the one that had preceded it in the Jardin des\nPlantes, my theosophist friend posed me the following\nquestions.\n\n\u201cWhat are cyclones? Are they waves of hatred, surges of\npassion, or emissions of psychic power?\u2019 to which he later\nadded: \u201cAre the followers of Papus aware of the manifestations\nthey produce?\u2019\n\nBy what appeared to be chance, but was in fact not chance\nat all, I had written to him and our letters had crossed.

The enclosed valley, the pine-clad hills, the\ndark woods, the stream cutting through the gorge, the village,\nthe church, the poor-house, the manure heaps, the puddles of\nmuck, the pig-sties, they were all there.\n\nHell? But I had been brought up to regard Hell with the\ndeepest contempt as an imaginary conception, thrown on the\nscrap-heap along with other out-of-date prejudices. All the\nsame, I could not deny a matter of fact, the only thing I could\ndo was to explain eternal damnation in this new way: we are\nalready in Hell. It is the earth itself that is Hell, the prison con-\nstructed for us by an intelligence superior to our own, in which\nIcould not take a step without injuring the happiness of others,\nand in which my fellow creatures could not enjoy their own\nhappiness without causing me pain.\n\nIt is thus that Swedenborg, perhaps without knowing it,\ndepicts our earthly life when meaning to describe Hell.\n\nHell-fire is our desire to make a name for ourselves in the\nworld. The Powers awaken this desire in us and permit the\ndamned to achieve their objectives. But when the goal is\nreached and our wish fulfilled, everything is found to be\nworthless and our victory meaningless. Vanity of vanities, all\nis vanity. Then, after our first disillusionment, the Powers\nfan the flame of desire and ambition. Yet it is not unappeased\nhunger that plagues us most but gratified greed, which leaves\nus with a loathing for everything. Thus the Devil is made to\nsuffer endless punishment by having every wish granted, and\ngranted instantly, so that he is no longer able to take pleasure\nin anything.\n\nWhen I compared Swedenborg\u2019s description of Hell with\nthe torments mentioned in the Germanic Mythology, I saw that\nthere was an unmistakable similarity between them, but to\nme personally the essential point was the fact that these two\nbooks had overwhelmed me at the same moment.

When I subjected my\npast life to close scrutiny and thought of my childhood, I\ncould see that even that had been like a prison sentence, an\ninquisitorial court. The tortures to which an innocent child\nhad been subjected could be explained in no other way than\nby assuming that we have had a previous existence, from which\nwe have been removed and sent here to suffer the consequences\nof misdemeanours of which we ourselves have no recollection.\nBecause of a faint-heartedness from which I often suffer, I\npushed away into the furthest recesses of my soul the impression\nthat my reading of Swedenborg had made upon me. But the\nPowers would no longer give me any peace.\n\nWhen I took a walk in the outskirts of the village, the\nlittle stream led me towards the gorge between the two hills.\nThe truly magnificent entrance to it, between masses of fallen\nrocks, lured me on with a strange and irresistible fascination.\nThe perpendicular side of the rock, upon which the ruined\ncastle stood, came down right to the bottom and formed a\ngateway to the ravine itself at the spot where the stream became\nthe mill-race.

Usually the fury of the storm abates in a short time\nand it moves away, but this one remained over my village for\ntwo solid hours, and I am sure that it was an attack on me\npersonally, that each flash was aimed at me but failed to hit\nthe mark.\n\nEvery evening my mother-in-law used to give me an\naccount of current events in the neighbourhood. What a vast\ncollection of domestic and other tragedies! Acts of adultery,\ndivorces, lawsuits between kinsfolk, murders, thefts, rapes,\nincestuous relationships, slanders. The castles and the villas, as\nwell as the cottages, housed wretches of every description, and\nI never took a walk along the roads without thinking of\nSwedenborg\u2019s Hell.

Until I get further orders I shall stay\nwhere I am.\u2019\n\nAfter the clock had struck six it was impossible to remain\nin that haunted place a moment longer. Unknown forces lifted\nme from my chair and I had to shut up shop.\n\nOn All Souls\u2019 Day, at about three o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\nthe sun was shining and the weather was calm. The procession\nof the villagers, led by the priests with banners and music,\nmarched to the church-yard to salute the departed. The church\nbells began to toll. Suddenly, without any preliminaries, with-\nout a warning cloud in the pale-blue sky, a storm broke loose.\nThe banners flapped and beat against the poles, the clothes of\nthe men and women in the procession tossed about in the\nwind, whirling clouds of dust rose up, the trees bowed and\nbent. It was a truly miraculous occurrence.\n\nI dreaded the coming night, and my mother was fore-\nwarned of its dangers. She gave me an amulet to wear round\nmy neck. It was a Madonna and a cross of sanctified wood,\nwhich had once formed part of the beam of a church more\nthan a thousand years old. I accepted it as a precious gift\nkindly offered, but some remnant of the religion of my\nancestors forbade me to hang it round my neck.\n\nAt about eight o'clock we had our supper. An ominous\nsilence reigned over our little circle round the lamp. It was\n", "138 INFERNO\n\npitch dark outside, the trees were hushed, all was silent. Then\ncame a sudden gust of wind, just one. It forced its way through\nthe chinks in the window uttering a wail like the sound of a\nJew\u2019s harp. Then it was over.\n\nMy mother looked at me with horror and clasped the child\nin her arms. I instantly realized what her glance implied:\n\n\u2018Leave this place, doomed man, and bring not the wrath\nof demons upon innocent heads!\u2019\n\nMy world collapsed in ruins. My last remaining happiness,\nthat of being with my daughter, had been snatched from me,\nand, as we sat there speechless and mournful, I bade a silent\nfarewell to life.\n\nWhen the meal was over I retired to my room, once roseate,\nnow black, and prepared for a nocturnal struggle; for I felt\nI was being menaced. By whom? I did not know, but I chal-\nlenged the Unseen whoever he might be, the Devil or the\nEternal, and prepared to wrestle with him as Jacob did with\nGod. \u00b0\n\nThere came a knock at the door. It was my mother, who\nhad had a premonition that this was going to be a bad night\nfor me and had come to invite me to sleep on the sofa in her\nsitting-room.\n\n\u2018The nearness of the child will save you,\u2019 she said.\n\nI thanked her, but assured her that there was no danger and\nthat I had nothing to fear so long as my conscience was clear.\n\nShe bade me good night with a smile.\n\nI donned my cloak, my cap, and my boots, in which to\ndo battle, firmly determined to sleep fully dressed, and ready\nto die like a bold warrior who, having faced life bravely,\ndefies death. But towards eleven o\u2019clock the air in the room\nbegan to thicken and a deadly anxiety got the better of my\ncourage. I opened the window. The draught threatened to\nput out the lamp and I shut it again. The lamp began to sing,\nto moan, to whine. Then all was silent.\n\nNearby a dog set up a miserable howl, a sound that popular\ntradition interprets as a funeral chant.\n\nI looked out of the window. Only the Great Bear was\nvisible. Down below in the poor-house a single candle was still\n", "THE DIARY OF A CONDEMNED MAN 139\nalight; an old woman was stooping over her work, awaiting\nrelease or perhaps dreading sleep and dreams.\n\nTired out, I lay down on my bed and tried to sleep. Im-\nmediately the same old game began again. An electric current\nsought out my heart, my lungs ceased to function, I had either\nto get up or die. I sat down on a chair, too utterly exhausted\nto read, and remained sitting there in a stupor for half an hour.\n\nThen, having made up my mind that I would wander about\nuntil day broke, I went out. The night was dark, the village\nwas asleep, but the dogs were not, and, at a summons from\none, the whole pack swarmed round me, their gaping jaws\nand gleaming eyes forcing me to beat a retreat.\n\nWhen I got back and opened the door of my room it\nseemed to me that the whole place was filled with animate and\nhostile beings. There was not a bit of room anywhere, and I\nfelt as if | were pushing my way through a crowd of people\nas I tried to reach my bed. Resigned, and resolved to die, I\nsank upon it. But at the last moment, just as I was suffocating\nin the grip of the invisible vulture, someone pulled me from\nmy bed and the hunt of the furies was on again. Defeated, all\nmy courage gone, driven frantic, I yielded to the Unseen and\nabandoned the battlefield of this unequal struggle.\n\nI tapped on the door of the sitting-room on the other side\nof the passage. My mother, who was still up and rapt in\nprayer, opened it.\n\nThe expression that came on to her face as soon as she saw\nme gave me a feeling of deep aversion for myself.\n\n\u201cWhat is it you want, my child?\u2019\n\n\u2018I want to die and then to be burned, or rather to be burned\nalive.\u2019\n\nNot another word did I need to utter. She had understood\nme, but, even as she struggled against her feeling of dread,\ncompassion and pious mercy got the upper hand and she her-\nself made the sofa ready for me, before retiring to the inner\nroom where she slept with the child.\n\nBy chance, always the same satanic chance, the sofa was\nexactly opposite the window and, as the same chance would\nhave it, the window had no blind. The black window, giving\n", "140 INFERNO\n\non to the dark of night, stared me in the face, and, what was\nmore, it was through this very window that the gust of wind\nhad whistled that evening as we sat at table.\n\nAt the end of my tether, I sank on to my couch, cursing\nthis omnipresent, inescapable chance that pursued me with\nthe obvious intention of making me the victim of persecution\nmania.\n\nFor five minutes I was allowed to rest, my eyes fixed on\nthe square of black. Then the unseen spectre came creeping\nupon my body and I got up. I remained standing in the middle\nof the room like a statue for I do not know how long, trans-\nformed into a stylite, sleeping or waking by turns.\n\nWho was it who had given me the strength with which to\nsuffer? Who was it who denied me death, which would deliver\nme from my torturers?\n\nWas it He, the Lord over life and death, to whom I had\ngiven offence when, after reading the work On the Delight of\nDying, Vhad experimented with suicide, believing myself ripe\nfor eternal life?\n\nWas I Phlegyas, doomed for his arrogance to suffer the\nagonies of Tartarus, or Prometheus, punished by the devouring\nvulture because he had revealed the secrets of the Powers to\nmortal man?\n\n(As I write these things I am reminded of the scene from\nthe story of the Passion where the soldiers spat in Jesus\u2019 face\nand some buffeted him and others smote him with the palms\nof their hands, saying as they did so, \u2018Prophesy unto us, thou\nChrist, who is he that struck thee?\u2019\n\nThe friends of my youth should be able to remember an\norgiastic evening in Stockholm on which the author of this\nbook played the soldier\u2019s part.)\n\n\u201cWho is he that struck thee??

Enemies,\nyes, those who had been injured by my ill-will; and each time\nI tracked down a new enemy it was because my conscience had\nbeen pricked.\n\nThe next day I was awakened, after a few hours\u2019 sleep, by\nthe sound of my little Christine\u2019s chirruping, and all was for-\ngotten. I applied myself to my usual occupations, which were\ngoing well. Everything I wrote was accepted immediately,\nproof enough that my sound sense and my intellect were\nunimpaired.\n\nAt the same time the newspapers circulated a rumour that\nan American scientist had discovered a way of turning silver\ninto gold. This cleared me of the suspicion that I was a prac-\ntitioner of the black art, a madman, or a charlatan. It was at\nthis moment that my friend the theosophist, who had been\nsending me pecuniary assistance, made efforts to win me over\nto his sect.\n\nWhen he sent me Madame Blavatsky\u2019s The Secret Doctrine\nhe did not succeed in concealing his anxiety to know my\nopinion of it. This put me in something of a dilemma, as I\nsuspected that our friendly relations depended on how I\nanswered him. The Secret Doctrine, that hotchpotch of all the\nso-called occult theories, that rehash of every scientific heresy,\nancient and modern, utterly worthless when the lady is ex-\npressing her own foolish and conceited ideas, and only inter-\nesting for the quotations it contains from little-known authors,\nhateful because of the conscious or unconscious deceptions it\nperpetrates, and because of the stories it tells about the exis-\ntence of Mahatmas.

He flung a sentence of excommunication\nat me, threatened me with the occult powers, intimidated me\nby hints of some form of coercion, and uttered prophecies\nlike some heathen, sacrificial priest. He concluded by sum-\nmoning me to appear before an occult tribunal, and swore\nthat I should never forget the 13th of November.\n\nI was in a painful predicament. I had lost a friend and was\nthreatened by want. By a devilish piece of bad luck, just\nas we were in the middle of our postal battle, a most\nunfortunate thing happened.\n\nL\u2019 Initiation published an article of mine in which I criti-\ncized the prevailing astronomical systems. A few days later\nTisserand, the director of the Paris Observatory, died. In an\nexcess of jocularity I hinted at a connection between these\ntwo events, recalling the fact that Pasteur had died the day\nafter the distribution of my book Sylva Sylvarum. My friend\nthe theosophist had no sense of humour. Being the most\ncredulous man in the world and perhaps better initiated than\nI into the black art, he was led to say that he believed that I\nwas practising bewitchment.\n\nImagine my terror when, after the letter that closed our\ncorrespondence, the most distinguished of Sweden\u2019s astrono-\nmers died from apoplexy. My anxiety increased, not without\nreason. To be accused of practising sorcery puts one in danger\nof one\u2019s life, and \u2018he who slays such a man need fear no\npunishment\u2019.\n\nTo add to my alarm, within the space of one month no\nfewer than five more or less well-known astronomers died,\none after another.\n\nThe man I stood in fear of was a fanatic, whom I credited\nwith the cruelty of a druid, combined with the Hindu sor-\ncerer\u2019s alleged power of killing at a distance,\n\nA new Hell of agonizing fear!

Now I really felt that I was doomed to die, and\nI put into a sealed envelope a paper denouncing my assassins\nin the event of my being overtaken by sudden death. Then I\nwaited.\n\nTen kilometres further east along the Danube lay the little\ntown of Grein, the most important place in the district. To-\nwards the end of November, when full winter had already\nset in, word was brought to me that a stranger from Zanzibar\nhad taken up his abode there, calling himself a tourist. This\nwas quite enough to awaken all the apprehensions and dark\nimaginings to which a sick mind is prone. I tried to find out\nmore about this stranger, whether he really was an African,\nwhat he was doing there, where he came from.\n\nNo information was to be had. A veil of secrecy enveloped\nthis unknown man, who haunted me night and day. In my\ngreat need, and always in the spirit of the Old Testament, I\ncalled upon the Eternal for His protection and for vengeance\nupon my enemies.\n\nThe Psalms of David were those that best expressed my\nthoughts and old Jacob was my God.

I was completely burnt out\nafter a sleepless night and repeated struggles with my invisible\nfoes, and I cursed my life and bewailed the absence of the sun.\n\nMy mother predicted that I should not regain my health\nuntil after Candlemas, when the sun would return to us.\n\n\u201cMy only ray of sunshine is here,\u2019 I said, pointing to my\nlittle Christine, who was sitting opposite me.\n\nAt that very moment the clouds, that had been growing\never heavier for the past weeks, suddenly parted and a beam\nof sunshine penetrated the room, lighting up my face, the\ntablecloth, and the china.\n\n\u2018Look, the sun, Papa! It\u2019s the sun!\u2019 cried the child, clasping\nher hands together.\n\nI rose from the table, confused, a prey to the most con-\nflicting emotions. Was it chance? No, I said to myself. The\nmiracle, the token? No, that would be too much to expect\nfor one so out of favour as myself. Besides, the Eternal does\nnot concern Himself with the insignificant affairs of a worm.\n\nYet this beam of sunshine remained with me like a broad\nsmile in the face of my discontent.\n\nDuring the two minutes that elapsed while I walked to\nmy cottage, the clouds banked up into the strangest shapes, and\nin the east, where they had drifted away, the sky was green\n\u2014emerald green, like a meadow in midsummer.\n\nI remained standing in my room, waiting for an inde-\nfinable something, lost in a feeling of contrition that was\ntranquil and unmixed with fear.\n\nThen, unheralded by lightning, came a clap of thunder,\na single clap, just above my head. My first feeling, as I waited\nfor the usual rain and storm, was fear. Nothing happened.\nComplete calm reigned.

The\ntruth is that I believed myself to be the Eternal\u2019s equal, believed\nthat I formed an integral part of His personality, emanated\nfrom His being, was an organ of His organism. He needed\nme in order to manifest Himself, otherwise He would have\nmade the lightning destroy me on the spot.\n\nWhat had caused such boundless conceit in a mortal?\nDid I originate from the beginning of time, when the rebel\nangels united in revolting against a ruler who was content to\nreign over a realm of slaves? Was that why my pilgrimage on\nearth had been like a running of the gauntlet, in which the\nmeanest of the mean had rejoiced in whipping me with rods,\nspitting on me, and defiling me?\n\nThere was not one among all imaginable humiliations that\nI had not endured, yet, all the same, my pride had grown\ncontinuously, in exact proportion to my abasement. What was\nthe meaning of this? Jacob, wrestling with the Eternal and\nemerging from the struggle, somewhat disabled, but with the\nhonours of war. Job, put to the test and persevering in justify-\ning himself in the face of punishments unjustly inflicted?\n\nShaken by all these incoherent ideas, I was forced by\nweariness to give in. My inflated ego collapsed and dwindled,\nso that the incident that had brought about all these specula-\ntions was reduced to a mere nothing, a clap of thunder in\nNovember!\n\nBut the echo of that clap of thunder began to resound\nagain and, once more overcome by ecstasy, I opened the Bible\nat random, praying to the Lord as I did so that He would speak\nyet louder so that I might understand.\n\nMy eyes instantly fell upon the following verses from the\nBook of Job.\n\n\u201cWilt thou even disannul my judgement?\n", "THE VOICE OF THE ETERNAL 147\n\nWilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be justified?\n\nOr hast thou an arm like God?\nAnd can\u2019t thou thunder with a voice like Him?\u2019\n\nI doubted no longer.

She watched me surreptitiously,\nbut with a searching glance, as if she wanted to discover\nwhat sort of an impression that majestic and spectacular per-\nformance had made.\n\n\u2018Did you hear it?\u2019 she asked.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed.

She was irresistible and I gave way to her pleading.\n\nOnce up there, my Christine demanded pen and paper,\nthen she issued orders for picture books, wanted me to look at\nthem too, to explain them and draw things for her.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t go to sleep, Papa.\u2019\n\nTired, completely exhausted, I could not imagine why I\nobeyed the child, but there was something in the tone of her\nvoice that I could not resist.\n\nThen an organ-grinder began to play a waltz, just outside\nthe door. I suggested to the child that she should dance with\nher nurse, who had come with her. Attracted by the sound of\nthe music, the neighbours\u2019 children came in too, and soon,\nafter the organ-grinder had been invited into the kitchen,\nthere was an improvised ball going on in my hall.\n\nThis went on for an hour and my dejection disappeared.\n", "150 INFERNO\n\nBut, in order to take my mind off what was going on, also\nto ward off my desire to sleep, I took up my Bible, always my\noracle, and opening it at random, I read:\n\n\u2018Now the spirit of the Lord had departed from Saul, and\nan evil spirit from the Lord troubled him.

That was just what I had suspected.\n\nThen, in the middle of all this merriment, my mother\ncame to look for the child and, seeing the dance that was\ngoing on, she stood amazed. She told me that quite suddenly,\nwithin the last hour, a woman of good family had gone mad.\n\n\u201cWhat form does her madness take?\u2019\n\n\u2018She dances, that old lady dances, dances indefatigably,\ndressed like a bride.

Nothing else, but this was always regarded as\na harbinger of death in my country. \u201cHere goes for death, then,\u2019\nthought I. After I had read for a quarter of an hour I wanted\nto use my handkerchief, which I had put under the bolster.\nIt was not there, but when I looked I found it on the floor.\nI bent down to pick it up. Something fell on my head and,\nwhen I ran my fingers through my hair, what should I find\nbut another piece of candlewax.\n\nInstead of being alarmed, I could not refrain from smiling,\nso absurd did the incident appear. Smile at death! That would\nnot be possible if it were not that life itself is so ridiculous.\nSuch a lot of fuss for so little result.

The sun shone\nupon the surrounding country with its endless horizons, and\non the white crests of the Alps that merged into the clouds.\nIt was as beautiful as Heaven. Could it be that the earth con-\ntained both Heaven and Hell and that there was in fact no other\nplace for punishment or reward? Perhaps. One thing is certain.\nWhen I think of the loveliest moments of my life I remember\nthem as heavenly, the worst as hellish.\n\nHad the future still in store for me any hours or minutes\nof this happiness, which cannot be purchased except by anxious\ncare and a tolerably clear conscience?\n\nI lingered on up there, little inclined to descend again into\nthe vale of suffering, and as I walked over the plateau behind\nthe crag to admire the earth\u2019s beauty I noticed that the isolated\ncrag that forms the actual summit had been hewn by Nature\ninto the shape of an Egyptian sphinx. On the gigantic head\nwas a cairn, topped by a little stick with a bit of white linen\nfastened to it as a flag.\n\nI was seized by an uncontrollable desire to take the flag\naway with me, and, ignoring the danger and without pausing\nto consider why it had been put there, I stormed the precipice\nand captured the flag. At the same moment, from the slopes\nbeside the Danube, I heard the unexpected strains of a wedding\n", "HELL LET LOOSE 153\nmarch, accompanied by joyous singing. It was a bridal pro-\ncession, invisible to me, but recognizable by the customary\nrifle-shots.\n\nChildish enough, and sufficiently unhappy to be able to\nextract the poetry from the most everyday and the most\nnatural events, I accepted this as a good omen.\n\nVery unwillingly, and with lagging footsteps, I descended\ninto that valley of pain and death, of sleepless nights and demons.\nMy little Beatrice! was waiting for me and for the mistletoe\nI had promised her. The mistletoe, that green twig that grows\nin snowy places and should really be cut with a golden sickle.\n\nFor a long time the old great-grandmother had been ex-\npressing a wish to see me, whether to bring about a recon-\nciliation or, since she was a visionary and a clairvoyant, for\nreasons which may have had roots in the occult, I did not know.\nI had made various excuses whereby to postpone seeing her,\nbut when the date for my departure was fixed my mother\ninsisted that I must visit the old lady to bid her farewell,\nprobably for the last time on this side of the grave.\n\nOn the 26th of November, a cold clear day, my mother,\nthe child, and I set off on our pilgrimage to the family mansion\nbeside the Danube.\n\nWe established ourselves at the inn and my mother-in-law\nwent on to her mother\u2019s house to announce my visit. While I\nwaited for her to return I wandered about in the fields and\ngroves which I had not seen for two years. Memories crowded\nupon me, the image of my wife was intermingled with every-\nthing. Frost and autumn rain had left a trail of devastation;\nthere was not a flower, not a blade of grass, where we two\nhad once plucked all the flowers of spring, and summer, and\nautumn. In the afternoon I was taken to see the old lady, who\nwas living in the summer cottage belonging to the villa, the\nplace in which my child had been born. It appeared that a\nscene reminiscent of the return of the prodigal had been ex-\npected. I feel nothing but repugnance for demonstrations of\nthat kind, so I confined myself to recalling memories of a\n\n1 Strindberg is thinking of himself as Dante, his daughter as Beatrice.\n", "154 INFERNO\n\nvanished paradise. My wife and I had painted the door and the\nwindow-frames in honour of little Christine\u2019s arrival in the\nworld.

But the walnut tree that\nThad planted the day after Christine\u2019s birth, that had vanished.\nThe \u2018Tree of Life\u2019, as we had called it, was dead.\n\nTwo years, two eternities, had passed since we said our\nfarewells, she on the bank, I on the boat that was to carry me\nas far as Linz on my way to Paris.\n\nWhich of us was responsible for the rupture? I was, I who\nhad murdered my own love and hers. Farewell, white house of\nDornach, field of thorns and of roses. Farewell, Danube. I\ncomfort myself with the thought that you were never more\nthan a dream, brief as summer, sweeter than reality, and that\nI do not mourn you.\n\nWe spent the night at the inn. At my urgent request my\nmother and the child stayed there with me to preserve me\nfrom a further tussle with death, of which, thanks to the sixth\nsense that had developed in me during six consecutive months\nof martyrdom, I had a premonition.\n\nAt ten o'clock that evening a gust of wind started to rattle\nthe door that opened on to the passage. I putin wooden wedges.\nIt was no use, it went on rattling. After that the wind whistled\nthrough the window, the stove howled like a dog, the whole\nhouse rocked like a ship.\n\nI could not sleep. At times it was my mother who moaned,\nat others the child who cried.\n\nIn the morning my mother was absolutely worn out by\nlack of sleep and other troubles that she concealed from me.\n\n\u2018Go, my child,\u2019 she said. \u2018I have had enough of the fumes of\nHell.\u2019\n\nSo I went, on a pilgrimage to the North, there to face the\nfire of the enemy at yet another station on the road to atone-\nment.\n", "13\nPilgrimage and Atonement\nTHERE are ninety towns in Sweden, but it was to the one I\nmost abhor that the Powers had condemned me.t\n\nI began by visiting the doctors.\n\nThe first labelled my trouble neurasthenia, the second\nangina pectoris, the third paranoia (mental illness), the fourth\nemphysema. This was enough to make me feel secure against\nbeing shut up in a madhouse.\n\nMeanwhile, to earn my bread I had to write articles for\na newspaper, but every time I sat down at my desk and took\nup my pen, Hell was let loose. They had hit upon a new device\nfor driving me mad. As soon as I had settled in a hotel an\nuproar would break out, very like that in the Rue de la Grande\nChaumie\u00e9re in Paris. People walked about, dragging their feet\nand moving furniture. I changed my room, changed my hotel;\nthe noise was always there, just above my head. I visited res-\ntaurants, but hardly had I chosen a seat in the dining-room\nbefore the row would begin. And, please note, I always asked\nthe other people present if they could hear the same noise that\nI did, and they always answered \u2018Yes\u2019, and their impression\nof it always tallied with mine.\n\n\u2018So,\u2019 said I to myself, \u2018this is not an aural delusion but a\ncarefully planned and widespread intrigue.\u2019 But one day, when\nIentered a shoe-shop quite by chance, the noise instantly began\nthere too. So it was not a well-planned intrigue, it was the\nDevil himself.

One day, after such a\nbacchanal, I had just finished breakfasting in my room. The\ntray of china and cutlery was still on the table and I had my\nback turned to it. A dull thud attracted my attention and I\nsaw that a knife had fallen to the floor. I picked it up and put\nit back carefully, so that the same thing should not happen\nagain. It was lifted up of itself and fell.\n\nSo, it was electricity.\n\nThat same morning I was writing to my mother-in-law,\ncompaining to her about the bad weather and life in general.\nImagine my surprise when, just as I had finished writing the\nwords \u2018the earth is dirty, the sea is dirty, and the heavens\nrain slush\u2019, I saw a drop of crystal-clear water fall on to the\npaper.\n\nNot electricity this time. A miracle!\n\nThat evening I was still at my desk when I was alarmed\nby a noise from the direction of the washstand. I looked round\nand saw that the piece of oil-cloth, upon which I stood when\nperforming my morning ablutions, had fallen down. In order\nto get to the bottom of the mystery, I hung it up again in such\na way that it could not possibly fall. It fell ail the same.\n\nWhat did this mean? My thoughts reverted to the occultists\nand their hidden powers. I left that town, taking with me my\nletter of denunciation, and went to Lund, where I had old\nfriends, doctors, psychiatrists, even theosophists, on whose\nsupport I counted for my temporal salvation.\n\nHow or why was I led to settle in that little university town?\nWas it not always regarded as a place of exile or penance for\nUppsala students when they had caroused more than was good\nfor their purses or their health? Was it a Canossa, where I\nshould have to renounce my exaggerated opinions before the\nsame young people who, between 1880 and 1890, had called\nme their standard-bearer? I well knew the situation there, and\nI was not ignorant of the fact that I had been excommunicated\n", "PILGRIMAGE AND ATONEMENT 157\nby the majority of the professors as a seducer of the young, and\nthat fathers and mothers feared me as if I had been the Devil\nhimself.\n\nIn addition, I had made personal enemies there, and I had\nincurred debts in circumstances that shed an ugly light on\nmy character. Popoffsky\u2019s sister-in-law and her husband lived\nthere and, as they both occupied a prominent position in\nsociety, they were well placed for causing me grave annoy-\nance. I even had relatives there who had disowned me, friends\nwho had renounced our acquaintanceship and become my\nenemies. In a word, it was the worst possible place to have\nchosen for a period of peace and quiet. It was a Hell, devised\nwith masterly logicality and divine ingenuity. It was there that\nI had to drain my cup to the dregs and reconcile the youth of\nLund with the outraged Powers.\n\nBy an accident, which had its picturesque side, I had re-\ncently bought myself\u2018a fashionable cloak with a cape and hood,\nof a flea~-brown colour and very like the habit of a Capuchin\nfriar. Thus it was in the garb of a penitent that I re-entered\nSweden after six years of exile.\n\nAbout the year 1885 a student society had been formed in\nLund which went by the name of \u2018The Young Gaffers\u2019, and\nwhose literary, scientific, and social interests could all be\ncharacterized as radical. Their programme, always in har-\nmony with the ideas of the moment, was first of all socialist,\nthen nihilist, and ended by making an ideal of general disinteg-\nration and fin-de-si\u00e9cle, with a suggestion of satanism and\ndecadence about it.\n\nThe leader of this society and the bravest of the paladins,\na friend of mine for years, though it was three since I had last\nseen him, came to visit me.\n\nHe was dressed as I was in a cloak, but his was that\nof a Franciscan friar. He had aged greatly and grown very\nthin. He was a pitiable sight and his face alone told me his\nstory.\n\n\u201cWhat, you too?\u201d\n\nYes, but it is all over now.\u2019\n\n1 Bengt Lidforss.\n", "158 INFERNO\n\nWhen I offered him a glass of wine he refused it, saying\nthat he was a teetotaller and no longer touched strong liquor.\n\n\u2018And what about \u201cThe Young Gaffers\u201d?\u2019\n\n\u2018They are dead.

Everyone is complaining that they suffer\nfrom nightmares, difficulty in breathing, affections of the\nheart.\u2019\n\n\u2018This is where I belong, then. I too suffer from the self-\nsame things.\u2019\n\nWe talked for a couple of hours about the signs and\nwonders that were taking place, and my friend told me of the\nsingular experiences in which first one and then another had\nbeen involved. In conclusion he told me that the youth of the\npresent day was expecting something new.\n\n\u2018People are longing for a religion, a reconciliation with\nthe Powers (their exact words), a re-establishment of harmony\nwith the unseen world. The naturalistic phase was potent and\nfruitful, but it has served its turn. There is nothing adverse\nto be said about the movement, nothing to regret, since the\nPowers ordained that we should pass through it. It was an\nexperimental phase, in which experiments that produced\nnegative results have proved to us the emptiness of certain of\nthe theories tested. A God, unknown for the present but who\nhas within himself the capacity for growth and development,\nreveals himself from time to time, though in the intervals he\nseems to leave the world to its fate, like the husbandman who\nlets the tares and the wheat both flourish until the harvest.\nEach time he has revealed himself his views have changed and\n", "PILGRIMAGE AND ATONEMENT 159\nhe has begun his new reign by introducing improvements, the\nfruits of his experience.\n\n\u201cSo we know that religion will reappear, but it will take\nother forms, for a compromise with former religions seems\nout of the question. It is not a reactionary phase that awaits us,\nnor is it a return to what has already run its course; it is an\nadvance towards something new. We must wait and see what\nthat will be.\u2019\n\nTowards the end of our conversation I flung out a question,\nmuch as one shoots an arrow at the clouds.\n\n\u2018Do you know anything about Swedenborg?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, but my mother has his works and, what is more,\nmiraculous things have happened to her.\u2019\n\nIt was no more than a step, then, from atheism to Sweden-\nborg.\n\nI asked if I might borrow Swedenborg\u2019s writings, and my\nfriend, that Saul among the young prophets, brought me\nArcana Coelestia. He also brought with him a young man\nwho had been pardoned by the Powers, an infant prodigy\nwho told me of an incident in his life history which was quite\nlike my own experiences, and as we compared our tribulations\nlight dawned upon us and we won deliverance with the help\nof Swedenborg.\n\nI thanked Providence, which had sent me to that despised\nlittle town, there to atone for my sins and find salvation.\n", "14\nThe Redeemer\nWueEN Balzac, in his book S\u00e9raphita, introduced my sublime\ncountryman Emanuel Swedenborg to me as the \u201cBuddha of\nthe North\u2019, he showed me the evangelistic aspect of the\nprophet. Now it was the Law that impressed me, over-\nwhelmed me, and set me free.\n\nBy a single word, just one, he brought light to my soul,\ndispelled my doubts, my vain speculations about my imagin-\nary enemies the electrical experts and the practitioners of black\nmagic, and this little word was Devastation. Everything that\nhad befallen me I found again in Swedenborg. The sensations\nof acute anxiety (angina pectoris), pressure on the chest, palpi-\ntations, what I called the electric girdle, they were all there,\nand the sum total of these phenomena constituted the spiritual\npurification known even to the apostle Paul, and mentioned\nby him in the Epistles to the Corinthians and to Timothy.\n\n\u2018T have judged that he that hath so done this deed, he shall\nbe delivered unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that\nthe spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.\u2019\n\n\u201cOf whom is Hymenzus and Alexander, whom I delivered\nunto Satan, that they might be taught not to blaspheme.\u2019\n\nWhen I read Swedenborg\u2019s dreams of 1744, the year before\nhe established relations with the unseen world, I discovered\nthat the prophet had endured the same nocturnal tortures as\nmyself. In fact, so striking was the similarity between our\nsymptoms that I was no longer in any doubt about the nature\n\n160\n", "THE REDEEMER 161\nof the malady that had struck me down. Arcana Coelestia\nsolved for me all the riddles of the past two years with such\naccuracy and force that I, a child of the latter half of this re-\nnowned nineteenth century, became unshakably convinced\nthat Hell exists, but that it is here, on earth, and that I had just\npassed through it.\n\nSwedenborg explained to me the reason for my stay in\nthe H\u00e9pital de Saint-Louis thus: Alchemists are attacked by\nleprosy, which produces itching scabs like fish-scales\u2014my\nincurable skin disease in fact.\n\nSwedenborg interpreted the meaning of the hundred con-\nveniences at the H\u00e9tel Orfila: They were the Hell of Excre-\nment.

When they see people\ndoing wrong, or contemplating a wrong; they punish them by\ngiving them a pain in their foot or the hand (!) or in the region\nof the stomach, and they do this with incomparable skill. A\nshudder foreshadows their arrival.\n\nBesides pains in the limbs, they make use of a painful con-\ntraction round the navel, like that produced by astinging girdle,\nand from time to time of sensations of suffocation, driven to the\nlength of anguish, and of a distaste for all food other than bread.\n\nOther spirits seek to convince me of the opposite of what\n\nL\n", "162 INFERNO\n\nthe educative spirits have told me. These contradictory spirits\nhave been men on earth, banished from the community be-\ncause of their villainy. Their approach is foreshadowed by a\nflickering flame that seems to come down in front of one\u2019s face.\nThey take up a position at the base of the back, from which\nthey manifest their presence through the limbs.\u2019\n\n(Flickering flames or sparks have appeared to me twice and\non both occasions in moments of revolt, when I had repudiated\neverything as empty dreams.)\n\n\u2018They preach that one shall put no faith in the teaching of\nthe educative spirits, which agrees with that of the angels.\nThey say that one shall not adapt one\u2019s conduct to this teach-\ning, but that one shall live in self-indulgence and liberty, just\nas one pleases. They usually make their appearance immedi-\nately after the others have gone. People know them for what\nthey really are and do not take much notice of them, but learn\nthrough them what good and evil are. For one acquires a\nknowledge of the nature of goodness through its opposite, and\nevery perception or idea that one has is formed by reflecting\nupon the difference between opposites, considered in different\nways and from different points of view.\u2019\n\nThe reader may remember the human faces, resembling\nthe marble sculptures of antiquity, into which my white\npillow-slips used to shape themselves at the H\u00e9tel Orfila.\n\nThis is what Swedenborg has to say about them:\n\n\u2018There are two characteristic signs which show that they\n(the spirits) are with a person. One is an old man with a white\nface. This is a sign that they should always speak the truth, and\ndo only what is right. . . . I have myself seen this old man\u2019s\nface. . . .

That is what has happened\nto me.\n\nI have done penance, I have mended my ways, but no\nsooner do I begin the work of resoling my soul than I have to\nadd yet another patch. If I put on new heels the uppers split.\nThere is no end to it.\n\nI\u20ac1 give up drinking and come home sober at nine o\u2019clock\nof an evening to a glass of milk, my room is full to overflow-\ning with all manner of demons, who pluck me from my bed\nand smother me under the bedclothes. If, on the other hand, I\ncome home drunk, towards midnight, I fall asleep like a little\nangel and wake up in the morning as fresh as a young god,\nready to work like a galley-slave.\n\nIf I shun women unwholesome dreams come upon me at\nnight. If I train myself to think well of my friends, if I confide\nmy secrets to them or give them money, I am betrayed, and\nif I lose my temper over a breach of faith it is always I who am\npunished.\n\nI try to love mankind in the mass, I close my eyes to their\nfaults, and, with limitless forbearance, forgive them their\nmeanness and their back-biting, and then, one fine day, I find\nthat I am an accomplice. If I withdraw from the company of\npeople I consider bad Iam immediately attacked by the demon\nof solitude. If I then seek for better friends I fall in with\nworse.\n\nFurthermore, when I vanquish my evil passions, and reach\nat least some measure of tranquillity by my abstinence, I ex-\nperience a feeling of self-satisfaction that makes me think I am\nsuperior to my fellow men, and this is the mortal sin of egotism,\nwhich brings down instant punishment.\n", "168 INFERNO\n\nHow are we to explain the fact that each apprenticeship in\nvirtue is followed by a new vice?\n\nSwedenborg solves this riddle when he says that vices are\nthe punishments man incurs for more serious sins. For instance,\nthose who are greedy of power are doomed to the Hell of\nSodomy. If we admit that the theory holds good we must\nendure our vices and profit by the remorse that accompanies\nthem as things that will help us to settle our final account.\n\nConsequently, to seek to be virtuous is like attempting to\nescape from our prison and our torments. This is what Luther\nwas trying to say in article XX XIX of his reply to the Papal\nBull of excommunication, where he proclaims that \u201cThe Souls\nin Purgatory sin incessantly, since they are trying to gain peace\nand to avoid their torments.\u2019\n\nSimilarly in article XXXIV: \u201cTo struggle against the Turks\nis nothing more than rising in rebellion against God, who is\nchastising us for our sins throughout the medium of the\nTurks.\u2019\n\nThus it is clear that \u201call our good deeds are mortal sins\u2019, and\nthat \u2018the world must be sinful in the eyes of God, and must\nunderstand that no one can become good except by the grace\nof God\u2019.\n\nTherefore, O my brethren, you must suffer without hope\nof a single lasting happiness in this life, since we are already in\nHell. We must not reproach the Lord if we see innocent little\nchildren suffer. None of us can know why, but divine justice\nmakes us suppose that it is because of sins committed before\never they arrived in this world. Let us rejoice in our torments\nwhich are so many debts repaid, and let us believe that it is out\nof pure compassion that we are kept in ignorance of the\nprimordial reasons for our punishment.\n", "16\nWhat Is Our Goal:\n\nSrx months have ebbed away and I still take my walk on the\nramparts. As I let my eyes stray over the lunatic asylum and\ntry to catch sight of the blue streak in the distance that is the\nsea, I fancy that I am on the look-out for the new era that is\ncoming, the new religion of which the world is dreaming.\n\nDark winter is buried, the fields are growing green, the\ntrees are in blossom, the nightingale is singing in the Observa-\ntory Gardens, but the melancholy of winter still weighs upon\nour spirits because of the many ominous things that are hap-\npening, the many inexplicable things that make even the\nsceptical uneasy. Cases of sleeplessness are increasing, serious\nnervous disorders are multiplying, invisible presences are of\ncommon occurrence, real miracles are taking place. People are\nwaiting for something to happen.\n\nA young man came to visit me. He asked:\n\n\u201cWhat ought I to do to sleep peacefully at night?\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat has happened?\u2019\n\n\u2018Upon my word, I cannot tell you, but I have a horror of\nmy bedroom, and I am moving elsewhere tomorrow.\u2019\n\n\u201cYoung man, you are an atheist and a believer in natural-\nism. What has happened?\u201d\n\n\u2018Devil take it! When I got home last night and opened my\ndoor someone took hold of my arm and shook me.\u2019\n\n\u2018So there was someone in your room.\u2019\n\n\u2018Why, no! I lit the candles and I could not see anyone.\u2019\n\n\u2018Young man, there is one whom we cannot see by the light\nof a candle.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat manner of thing is he?\u2019\n\n169\n", "170 INFERNO\n\n\u2018He is the Unseen, young man. Have you taken sulphonal,\npotassium bromide, morphia, or chloral?\u2019\n\n\u2018T have tried them all.\u2019\n\n\u2018And the Unseen won\u2019t decamp? Well, then, you want to\nsleep peacefully at night, and you have come to ask me how\nto do so. Listen to me, young man. I am no doctor, nor am I\na prophet; I am an old sinner, doing penance. Do not expect\nany sermons or prophecies from a ruffian who needs all the\ntime he can spare to preach sermons to himself. I too have\nsuffered from sleepless nights and deep dejection. I too have\nfought face to face with the Unseen, and I have at last regained\nthe power of sleep and got back my health. Do you know\nhow? Guess!\u2019\n\nThe young man guessed what I meant and lowered his\neyes.\n\n\u201c \u201cSo you have guessed. Depart in peace and sleep well.\u2019\n\nYou see, I had to hold my tongue and let people guess\nwhat I meant, for the instant I presumed to play the friar\npeople turned their backs upon me.\n\nA friend asked me, \u201cWhat is our goal?\u2019\n\nTo him I said, \u2018I cannot tell you, but for me personally it\nseems that the way of the Cross is leading me back to the faith\nof my forefathers.\u2019\n\n\u201cCatholicism?\u201d\n\n\u2018It seems so. Occultism has played its part by giving me a\nscientific explanation of miracles and demonology. Theosophy,\nhaving opened the road to religion, is outworn now that it has\nre-established a cosmic system that punishes and rewards.\nKarma will become God, and the Mahatmas will be revealed\nas regenerated Powers, as disciplinary spirits (demons) and\nspirits that instruct (spirits of inspiration). Buddhism, much\nextolled by the youth of France, has introduced resignation\nand a worship of suffering that leads directly to Calvary.\u2019\n\nWith regard to my homesickness for the Mother Church,\nPa is a long story, but I should like to give a summary\nof it.\n", "WHAT IS OUR GOAL? 171\n\nSwedenborg, by teaching me that one is forbidden to\nabandon the religion of one\u2019s fathers, had clearly pronounced\na judgement upon Protestantism, which he says constitutes an\nact of treachery against the mother religion. To put it better,\nProtestantism is a chastisement, inflicted upon the barbarians\nof the North. Protestantism is the Exile, the Babylonian Cap-\ntivity, but a return to the promised land seems imminent. The\ntremendous strides that Catholicism has made in America, in\nEngland, and in Scandinavia are a prophecy of the great re-\nconciliation that is to come. The Greek Orthodox Church,\ntoo, has recently been stretching out a hand to the West.\n\nHere you have the socialists\u2019 dream of a United States of\nthe West, interpreted in a spiritual sense. But I beg you not to\nbelieve that political theories are what is leading me back to\nthe Roman Church. It is not I who have sought out Catholi-\ncism; it is Catholicism that laid hold on me, after pursuing me\nfor years. My child, who has been brought up a Catholic, and\nthat against my will, has taught me what beauty there can be\nin a cult that has been preserved intact since its inception. I\nhave always preferred the original to the copy. My prolonged\nstay in my daughter\u2019s homeland taught me to admire the\nsincerity of the religious life there. My stay in the H\u00e9pital de\nSaint-Louis had the same effect, and finally came my\nexperiences of the past months.\n\nAfter making this survey of my life, which showed me that\nI had been delivered over to the whirlwind, like certain of the\ndamned in Dante\u2019s Hell, and after recognizing that, all in all,\nthe only purpose of my existence had been to humble and\nbesmirch me, I decided to meet the hangman halfway and\nconduct the torture myself. I felt I wanted to live my life in\nthe midst of suffering, filth, and the agony of death. To this\nend I resolved to apply for a situation as a male nurse at the\nhospital of the Fr\u00e9res Saint-Jean-de-Dieu in Paris. This idea\ncame to me on the morning of the 29th of April after an en-\ncounter I had with an old woman with a face like a death\u2019s-\nhead. When I got home I found S\u00e9raphita lying open on my\ntable and, on the right-hand page, a sliver of wood pointing\nto the following sentence:\n", "172 INFERNO\n\n\u2018Do for God what you have done for the furtherance of\nyour own ambition, what you do when you devote yourself\nto an art, what you did when you loved one of His creatures\nmore than you loved Him, or when you sought to explore\nsome secret of human knowledge. Is not God Himself\nknowledge... ?\n\nThat afternoon the newspaper L\u2019Eclair arrived and\u2014what\na coincidence!\u2014the hospital of the Fr\u00e9res Saint-Jean-de-Dieu\nwas twice mentioned in its columns.\n\nOn May the 1st I read for the first time Sar Peladan\u2019s book,\nComment on devient mage.\n\nSar Peladan, about whom I had until then known nothing,\nnow burst upon me like a tempest, a manifestation of\nNietzsche\u2019s Superman, and with him Catholicism made its\nsolemn and triumphant entry into my life.\n\nHe who shall come, had he indeed come in the person of\nPeladan? Poet, prophet, philosopher\u2014is it really he, or must\nwe wait upon the coming of another?\n\nI do not know, but after having passed through this gate-\nway to a new life I began to write this book on the 3rd of\nMay.\n\nOn the sth of May I received a visit from a Catholic priest,\na proselyte.\n\nOn the 14th of May I saw Gustavus Adolphus! in the ashes\nof the stove.\n\nOn the 14th of May I read the following in Sar Peladan.\n\n\u201cAround the year one thousand one could believe in spell-\ncasting; now, as we approach the year two thousand, it has\nbeen established beyond doubt that there are certain indi-\nviduals who possess the fatal power of bringing misfortune\nupon those who injure them. If you refuse such a person his\ndemands your mistress will be unfaithful; lash out at him and\nyou will have to take to your bed. Any evil that you inflict\nupon him will rebound twofold upon your own head. Never\nmind; chance will explain this inexplicable combination of\n\n1 King of Sweden, 1611-1632, and champion of Protestantism.\n", "WHAT IS OUR GOAL? 173\ncircumstances; chance meets all the requirements of modern\ndeterminism.\u2019\n\nOn May 17th I read what the Dane Jorgensen, a convert to\nCatholicism, has written about the Monastery of Beuron.\n\nOn May 18th a friend, whom I had not seen for six years,\narrived in Lund and took a flat in the same house as myself.\n{magine my emotion when I discovered that he had recently\nbeen converted to Catholicism. He lent me a copy of the\nRoman missal that I had lost the preceding year, and when I\nread the Latin hymns and songs of praise again I felt as if I had\nreturned home.\n\nOn the 27th of May, after a series of conversations on the\nsubject of the Mother Church, my friend despatched a letter\nto the Belgian monastery where he had received baptism, re-\nquesting them to allow the author of this book to seek refuge\nthere.!\n\nOn May 28th I heard a rumour that Annie Besant had\nbecome a Catholic, but it has not been confirmed.\n\nI am still awaiting an answer from the Belgian monastery.\nBy the time this book has been printed I shall have received\none. What then? And thereafter? A new jest on the part of\nthe Gods? For when we weep scalding tears they roar with\nlaughter.\n\n1Solesmes. Strindberg contemplated going into retreat there, but in fact never\ndid so.\n", "Epilogue\nI first concluded this book with the words: \u201cWhat a jest, what\na miserable jest this life is, after all!\u2019\n\nAfter a little reflection it seemed to me that they were un-\nworthy and I crossed them out. But I could not rid myself of\nmy perplexity, and I therefore turned to the Bible, to find in\nit the illumination I so ardently desired.\n\nThe holy book, endowed more than any other with the\nmarvellous gift of prophecy, answered me in the following\nwords:\n\n\u201cAnd I will set my face against that man, and will make\nhim a sign and a proverb, and I will cut him off from the\nmidst of my people, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.t\n\nAnd if the prophet be deceived when he has spoken a\nthing, I the Lord have deceived that prophet, and I will stretch\nout my hand upon him, and will destroy him from the midst\nof my people Israel.\u2019\n\nThis is what my life amounts to then, to be a sign and an\nexample for the betterment of others, to be a laughing-stock\nto show the futility of glory and fame, a laughing-stock to en-\nlighten youth about the way in which they should not live. A\nlaughing-stock who thought he was a prophet, but stands re-\nvealed as an impostor. But it is the Lord who has led this false\nprophet astray and caused him to speak, so the false prophet\ncan feel that he is blameless, as he has only been playing the\npart assigned to him.\n\n1 Proverb. The word used in the 1820 French Bible from which Strindberg quoted\nwas \u2018jouet\u2019, laughing-stock.\n174\n", "EPILOGUE 175\n\nBehold, my brothers, one human destiny among many,\nand confess that the life of a man may well look like a jest.\n\nWhy has the author of this book been punished in such an\nextraordinary way? Read the miracle-play that concludes his\ndrama Master Olof (verse edition), He wrote this miracle-play\nthirty years ago, before he knew anything about the sect of\nheretics who called themselves Stedinger. Pope Gregory IX\nexcommunicated them in the year 1232 because of their\nsatanic teaching, which was that \u201cLucifer the good God, ex-\npelled and dethroned by \u201cThe Other\u201d, will come again when\nthe usurper, who is called God, has earned the contempt of\nmankind through his wretched rule, his cruelty, and his in-\njustice, and has himself become convinced of his incompe-\ntence\u2019.\n\nThis Prince of the World, who condemns mortals to sin\nand punishes virtue by the Cross and the stake, by sleeplessness\nand nightmares, who is he? The tormentor, to whom we\nhave been consigned because of some unknown or forgotten\ncrime, committed in a previous existence? And what of\nSwedenborg\u2019s disciplinary spirits, those guardian angels who\nshield us from spiritual evils?\n\nWhat a Babylonian confusion!\n\nSt Augustine considered it imprudent to foster doubts\nabout the existence of demons. Thomas Aquinas declared that\ndemons could summon up storms and call down thunderbolts,\nand also that these spirits were able to confer their power upon\nmortals. Pope John XXII bewailed the illicit practices of his\nenemies when they tormented him by sticking nails into his\nportrait (bewitchment). Luther believed that all accidents,\nbroken limbs, falls, outbreaks of fire, and most illnesses, arose\nfrom the machinations of devils. What is more, Luther held\nthat certain individuals have already found their Hell in this\nlife.\n\nIs it not with good reason, then, that I have christened my\nbook Inferno?\n", "176 EPILOGUE\n\nIf the reader doubts that what I say is true and thinks it is\ntoo pessimistic, let him read first my autobiography The Son\nof a Servant, and then A Madman\u2019s Defence.\n\nThe reader who is inclined to consider that this book is a\nwork of imagination is invited to consult the diary I wrote up\nday by day from 1895, of which the above is merely a version,\ncomposed of extracts expanded and rearranged.\n"]

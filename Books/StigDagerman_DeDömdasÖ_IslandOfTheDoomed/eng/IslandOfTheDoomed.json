["The Thirst of Dawn\nMind you, gin with a touch of meltwater from a\ncascading mountain stream, a few half-chewed young\nholly leaves, a pinch of roasted cardamom soaked in\ngallic acid, hastily swallowed at dawn as the car door\nslams shut on the last peal of laughter - ah, well -\n\nLucas Egmont\u2019s right hand crept a little way in his\nsleep over the rough, glittering, salt-encrusted sand,\ndragged by his finger tips. Was it caressing a cheek? A\nlong worm, white, but with thread-like, closely-packed\njoint rings in deepest black, suddenly seemed to emerge\nfrom the lapping surf and come wriggling over the\ngently sloping beach, menacing, terrifying. Was it real,\nor was it just a figment of his fear?\n\nLucas Egmont lay prostrate with his uninjured leg\npressed close to the ground, a position not as comforting\nas it seemed, since quite soon after sunset the sand began\nto transmit a sharp, aggressive chill which enveloped his\nlimbs in an inflexible film, hard as armour-plate,\nbecoming ever more unyielding as this island fell\nfurther and further through the night.\n\nYes, fell. Was he alone in noticing that the nights no\nlonger wafted down from some roof up above, or that\n", "daylight no longer surged in like white gas filling the\nblack balloon? No, the shifts were violent and unex-\npected: candles lit to produce an apparently reliable\nflame, and then suddenly snuffed out - but the hand\ndoing the snuffing was never glimpsed. Was he alone on\nthis hurtling planet, this sand-strewn marble plunging\ndown into the cosmic well? Transparent strata of air\ngreen at the edges, mauve streaks, deep-red flames\nflashing past and driving wedges like elephant tusks into\none\u2019s own trembling being, which itself was constantly\nchanging colour, chameleon-like, in the constant flux.\nBlue bands broken brutally asunder by exploding\nformations of violently yellow swallows\u2019 wings.\nFathomless darkness, the same air, but the colour itself\nmust have a consistency enabling it to check the speed of\ndescent. The fall through the night was no less terri-\nfying, but now the pace was slower. Swarms of sparks\nrose slowly in the form of stars encircling the island and\nwere visible far below in a grey, milky layer where\nwhite rivulets trickled in as if from some hidden giant\nudder.\n\nDawn. Lucas Egmont, lying prostrate in the sand, his\nwounded leg with its pierced calf raised ina slight curve\nlike a long bridge, sloping gently down on each side,\nwas woken slowly by the grey, bitter-sharp streaks\nbrushing his eyelids. His eyes cowered in terror under\ntheir trembling lids as he watched his hand coming\ncrawling towards him over the sand. A swollen, toad-\nlike creature with bleeding limbs. \u2018Go away!\u2019 he\nwanted to scream, \u2018Leave me alone!\u2019 - but the creature\nmerely dug holes in the ground, from which dazzling\nwhite strands of smoke, as thin as copper wire, rose\nskywards.\n\nNote his predicament: he wanted to scream but found\n", "it impossible: his swollen tongue lay like a large,\nquivering, clenched fist in his mouth. When they'd run\naground, the metal kegs of fresh water had been hurled\noverboard and split open against the sharp reef. Now\nthey were lying there like seals halfway out of the water\non the seaward side of the reef, and the slow swell,\ndetaching itself from the horizon in an endless series of\nblue pulses, drummed all day long with its soft knuckles\non their gleaming metal shoulders.\n\nAt least they had some music, then. The muffled,\nhollow roll of funeral drums droned on relentlessly,\npenetrating the swishing sighs of the surf, and as the\nisland plunged through the scorching expanses of fiery\nyellow, Lucas Egmont could feel fine, live electric\nwires linking his auditory nerves to the restless\nthrobbing from the reef. He tried to tear himself away\nfrom the agonizing noise by fleeing to the interior of the\nisland, but the wires trailed behind him over grinding,\nbone-dry sand, squelching shallows, sharp-toothed\npinnacles of rock, in whose shadows huge brown\nlizards, iguanas, lurked. Their noisy thudding pursued\nhim through the dense, green, hissing scrub, pregnant\nwith mysterious silence, into shoulder-high grass\ncrowned with large, frightening panicles and filled\nwith mysterious little sounds; from snakes, perhaps, or\nsome of those little rabbits hungry Tim Solider claimed\nto have glimpsed at the edge of the island\u2019s under-\ngrowth.\n\nThe run set his heart pounding, the wound in his calf\nopened up, and at last, exhausted by the loss of blood\nand the terror ripping him apart, he came up on to the\nopen, weather-worn rocks looming high above the thin\nstrip of sand which encircled the island like a frieze.\n\n- There was usually one of the others wandering about up\n", "there, peering down into the lagoon for edible fish,\ngazing into the distance in the all too vain hope of seeing\nanother, more amenable and more communicative\nisland bobbing up and down against the horizon. \u2018Mr\nEgmont, Mr Egmont!\u2019 they would cry those first few\ndays when the meat was still appetizing and healthily\nred in the red provision boxes that had floated ashore.\n\u2018Mr Egmont, let me help you! Your leg...\u2019\n\nCouldn\u2019t they hear the incessant drumming from the\nreef, throbbing away in his head through these fiendishly\ndesigned, elastic wires, no matter where he went?\n\nAh well! As he lay here, he wondered if it might be\na dream after all. Could it really be true that these\nalmost paralysed legs he couldn\u2019t prevent from tremb-\nling, their flesh swelling up and gradually turning blue -\nGod, if only he had a knife - had carried him over the\nsteep slope of the island, past these people wandering\nabout without understanding the seriousness of his\npredicament, never mind their own? He\u2019d have loved to\nprise open their jaws and convince himself once and for\nall that their tongues were just as much like grotesque,\nbloated, slimy lumps of sand as his own. Right to the\nvery end, indeed, as long as there was one last drop of\nwater left, if their legs would still carry them, they\u2019d\nbe scuttling around on the high ground as carefree as\nbutterfly-hunters, sleeping through the dawn even\nthough every change of light brought them ever closer\nto the bottom of the world.\n\nAaah! Without his being able to move a limb to\nprevent it, a whole series of groans, cadences with\nneither beginning nor end, suddenly started shooting\nthrough him, thumping at his diaphragm, rasping\nagainst his chest, burning into his throat, forcing their\nway like daggers past his tongue. Where were they\n\n6\n", "going? Suddenly a noise spilled out all around him,\nseeming to transport him, to raise him up, to envelop\nhim on all sides like water, running into his ears, hot and\nstimulating like steam from a bath; undercurrents\ncarried him slowly through widening channels, and his\nbody rotated slowly in response to their slightest\nmovements, as if on a swivel; all the time, his skin could\nfeel the gentle, gloved pressure from the noise, which\nwas now becoming more intense; persistent, groping\nfingers stretched his skin until it shimmered like a\ntransparent membrane in the penetrating green light of\nthe water, his nerves coiled themselves painfully around\nthree of those cruel fingers, and then sank down into\nfast-flowing, bitingly cold water: it was like being\nskinned alive until nothing remained but the sensitive\ncore of his being - and then he woke up and found\nhimself on the usual little meadow of his  thirst-\ndream:\n\nGrass, the grass of childhood with its soft, seed-laden\ntips, his pony Pontiac loping over the meadow, the grass\nwhispering past its haunches; the saddle had come loose\nand was thumping, thumping against its shoe-polished\nblack flanks. Racing over the long, green grass and\nflinging his arms round the neck of the dancing animal\nwith a shriek of suddenly felt pain and incipient\nhappiness. A damp muzzle imprinting itself on his nape,\nhis bare neck, his hot brow, being forced gently down\ninto the warm grass of summer. For it\u2019s always summer\nin this dream, with its big, white butterfly fluttering\nhither and thither around his summery head. Up in the\nsaddle now, kicking against Pontiac\u2019s belly, the trees in\nthe park dripping sun-drops, and look! That cricket ball\nUncle Jim hit into the mists the other evening, there it is\n\n' by the roots of that oak tree - but why not, let it stay\n", "there! Pontiac's panting now, its black hide\u2019s stretching\ntighter and tighter over its heart, lungs, nerves, but the\nboy in the red cap on its back is still urging it on with the\nheels of his shoes. Now Pontiac\u2019s galloping down the\nmiddle of the path in the big park, dust rising around its\nhooves; the tracks made by the cal\u00e9che meander first\none way, then the other, and as they career round a\nbend, it suddenly collapses on to its knees and its head\nthuds dully into the sand.\n\nThe gardener\u2019s children appear immediately from\ntheir hiding place behind the oak tree; they stand\nlooking in silence, just looking in silence, at the horse\nand rider. A boy and a girl, their incongruously long\narms hanging down like unemployed pendulum cords;\ntheir four eyes are like membranes stretched over their\nhatred, their clothes are scruffy and too often washed\nand, with some difficulty, Lucas Egmont recognizes\nthem from the distant past as having once been his own.\nNeither of them steps forward, they just stand there in\nsilence, looking at the rider and the dead horse; the four\nlegs of the dead horse are still now, no longer twitching,\nand the dust slowly settles, forming a powdery film on\nthe horse\u2019s hindquarters, which are still glowing with\nthe sweat it exuded when it was still alive. Everything is\nstill now, and the shadows cast by the oak suddenly\nbecome sharp black cavities chiselled into the road; the\nsoughing of the leaves fades away, and beyond the park,\nthe windmill with the damaged sail that can always be\nheard precisely because it\u2019s damaged, falls silent; the\nnarrow, white path is behind him and in front of him,\nand beside him is Pontiac, the dead horse. The breathing\nof the gardener\u2019s children has overshadowed the world,\nthe great park is veiled in lace and the clouds of the\nsummery blue sky, even the twittering of the birds\n", "filter through as Lucas Egmont stands there beside the\ndead horse.\n\nSo as not to be overshadowed himself, or for some\nother reason he may not even know about until quite\nlong afterwards, he takes out his silk handkerchief,\nbends down and polishes his brown shoes, made of the\nvery best patent leather. He does it very slowly and\ncarefully and methodically: first the long, rather\npointed toes, till they sparkle like a halberd in the sun,\nand then the rest as far as the nicely rounded heels. All\nthe time, he keeps glancing surreptitiously at the bare\nfeet of the gardener\u2019s children; he wants to see them\ntrembling, digging their toes into the sand, quivering\nwith impatience before running off into the park. He\nsimply wants to defeat their breathing. Then, with the\nsame preposterous care, he brushes the dust from his\nriding breeches, all the time glancing guardedly at the\ngardener\u2019s children\u2019s bare legs: he wants to see them\nstart dancing, shattering the strained silence - but\nnothing of the sort happens. Their legs are as still as\nPontiac\u2019s dead ones. The dust from off his clothes just\nfalls slowly down on to the dead horse\u2019s body, on which\nthe sweat has now dried, and the slime from its very last\npanting is already being invaded by flies.\n\nFor quite a while, in fact, nothing at all happens. The\ngamekeeper\u2019s dogs, whose chains can usually be heard\nall over the district, don\u2019t seem to be stirring from their\nkennels, and there\u2019s no sound of hammering from the\ncastle smithy, either. He takes off his short, red velvet\njacket in bewilderment, and flaps it around a few times\nover the horse; in eerie silence, masses of insects are\nnow sinking their stings into its soft flesh, and an army\nof red ants marches out from the grass, crosses over the\n\n\u201cpath like an open vein, up the horse\u2019s tail, which has\n9\n", "suddenly lost its sheen, and spreads out over its back and\nbelly in fan formation. The long arms of the jacket have\nbeen embroidered by his grandmother: a man reading\nbooks suspended in mid-air, white roses over naked\nsabre-blades, the family coat-of-arms. In order to delay\nthe life-or-death decision, for that is what it could\neasily be, and in order to gain control of the gardener\u2019s\nchildren\u2019s breathing, his hands dwell for an eternity on\neach rose and each sabre. Is there still no sound to be\nheard in the silence of the park? The splash of an oar in\nthe pond, subdued whispers from the lads cutting the\nhedges? No, only the breathing. Its hands, sticky with\nlow desire, are now approaching Lucas from all sides.\nHe looks at the pendulum-cord arms of the gardener\u2019s\nchildren, more motionless than ever; the slightest little\nmovement - they could bend down with respectful\nexpressions on their faces and stroke the horse, on its\nhindquarters, for instance - anything could yet come to\nhis rescue; but silence and being rooted to the spot are\nstill equally unbearable. And then, it being the only\nrespite he has left, he takes off his red hat extremely\nslowly and beats it over his knee, at the same time\nkeeping an eye on the gardener\u2019s children\u2019s hair, which\nseems to have been pulled together and held in place at\nthe top by a dull copper ring; but they\u2019re still as marble\nstatues, leaning against the horse in silence. And then all\nis lost; cap in hand, he suddenly has no option but to\nreact to their brutal breathing and, beside himself with\nsorrow, fear, regret \u2014 indeed, everything, Lucas looks\ninto the eyes of the gardener\u2019s children, one after the\nother. Implacable flames of hatred, like the flames from\na welding gun, shoot back at his own eyes, and with a\nshudder he acknowledges the triumph with which\nthey're celebrating his fall and the dead horse, and he\u2019s\n10\n", "possessed by feelings he\u2019s had to learn to suppress from\nthe very start in connection with cricket, riding,\nhunting with his falcon Ajax, and perhaps also all those\nshy detours to avoid confronting the local poor\nchildren: it\u2019s very much like what he knows as guilt\nfeelings.\n\nFor a moment, nothing but motionless pain; like a\nbrook of bitter wine, the red ants are now streaming\nover the road, and the dead horse\u2019s belly and hind-\nquarters are soaked in ants; flies and other winged\ninsects take fright and fly silently up into the treetops.\nAnd then, without meaning to do it quite so violently\nperhaps, he delivers a kick right into the horse\u2019s side, so\nvicious that one of its hooves rises up a little, killing\nseveral ants underneath it.\n\nNow the boy\u2019s running as if he means never to return,\nas if he wants to place light years between himself and\nthe park, down the white summery path, where the\nwheel tracks of the cal\u00e9che and the hoof-marks from its\nfour horses are imprinted in the dust like an endless trail\nof silver coins between two parallel lines. - And the\nman who\u2019s dreaming knows full well why the boy\u2019s\nrunning and why he kicked the horse as well, but the\nlittle boy on the white path with the red velvet jacket\nover his shoulder knows nothing, except that the hedge\nis suddenly closing in on him and the frog he\u2019s so afraid\nof is lying there green, smelly and disgusting at his feet;\nhe runs between looming carriage wheels, big cart-\nhorses, ploughs lying on the ground and white hens\nfluttering in all directions, he reaches the castle garden,\nruns over flower beds, past groups of lilies and his\nmother\u2019s elegant society lady-friends, sleeping on the\nlawn with handkerchiefs over their faces, runs through\nthe little door and up to the library and only now bursts\n\n11\n", "into tears as he dives on to the fur rug and burrows his\nwhole self into its aroma of bear\u2019s blood and cigars.\n\nNow the years go by, and he slowly learns to\nunderstand. He avoids the park; filled with a strange\nsort of despair, as the evenings wear on he often stands\nat the french windows in the tower, staring down into\nthe darkness between the trees; if he sees a raven dive\ndown among some blue trunks in the direction of the\nwindmill, whose halting sails are the only thing un-\nchanged, he immediately imagines the horse is still lying\nthere on the path, old carrion with deep cavities in its\nflesh, marks made by beaks and teeth, and in a state of\nconfusion and despair, he wants to race down the tower\nstaircase and dig a grave for his old friend, but darkness\nis falling fast and he always collapses into somebody\u2019s\narms and is carried unconscious through the cold, damp\nhalls, stinking of dust and rotting portraits, back to his\nroom in the green shadow of the wing wall.\n\nSick, they whisper in the castle. Barmy, out in the\nvillage. Indeed, psychologists, psychiatrists, psycho-\ntherapists and psychoanalysts, all those concertina-\ntuners of the soul, come rolling up by train, motor\ncycle, car, bus and aeroplane to his bed, like suitors in\nold marriage sagas: schemes are drawn up, diagrams\nmultiply, ink is always having to be ordered from the\ntown, armouries and store-rooms for the family\nmummies are now adapted to make libraries and\nlaboratories, questions are placed before him from left,\nright and centre, with the greatest solemnity, all\nrequiring answers; throw paper aeroplanes from the\nroof, the oscillations of the soul must be investigated\nthoroughly; a steady stream of equipment looking like\nsmall fountains or dish-washers keeps turning up, and\neverything is very interesting and very confusing.\n\n12\n", "But the terror remains, and the guilt, all the other\nflotsam as well; somebody wants to lead him down to\nthe park like a bull, they show him samples of gravel\nfrom the park path and from entirely different ones and\ntell him, quite correctly, that there\u2019s next to no\ndifference between them. Certificates with all kinds of\nwarranties state, quite correctly, that pony Pontiac was\ngiven away as food to a starving family dependent on\nthe estate, people who'd never been dissatisfied with\ntheir lot and become involved with those agitating for\nbetter food. But in order to understand for himself -\nthat\u2019s what\u2019s being denied him, after all - how to sort\nout the dark secrets of the events, he runs away early\none morning, as the servants are approaching with\nropes and a palanquin to take him out into the park,\nraces up the blue spiral staircase and out on to the roof\nbehind the old defences, the haunts of jackdaws and the\nplace urchins would love to visit. Dark points gather\namong the statues in the courtyard below, drawing-\npin-small faces suddenly open out like buds from their\nblack calyxes.\n\n\u2018Enough of your ropes and silly questions,\u2019 he calls\ndown to them, balancing ona pinnacle, standing on one\nleg and leaning out over the silent abyss. \u201cEnough of\nyour doctors, medicines and silly machines, X-ray\nmachines, the whole lot!\u2019 His father is no doubt down\nthere somewhere as well, the old officer with his mad\ncircus dreams. Yes, there he is, he\u2019s running now, a\ntwo-legged ant scuttling across the courtyard, no doubt\nthat\u2019s his spurs glinting in the sun. Then there\u2019s life and\nmovement everywhere: coaches are harnessed, cars\ncome creeping up like ugly beetles, boxes are loaded on\nboard, people climb in and out, horns are sounding\n\n- non-stop, and the sound flies up towards him like large\n13\n", "mosquitoes, and at last the column of vehicles starts\nflowing out towards the main road, sluggish as pitch -\nand Lucas runs downstairs in order to solve the mystery\nof the pony Pontiac and the gardener\u2019s children in peace\nand quiet.\n\nBut instead, his father grabs him roughly by the arm\nand drags him off through the deserted state-rooms\nwhere the smell of dying portraits is becoming more\nand more unbearable - people in various stages of\ndecomposition even when alive start to smell like\nportraits after a certain number of years. Into the\nlibrary, where father bolts the door, draws the curtains,\nlights the candles in the candelabra, and takes down\nfrom the wall the whip with the twelve-foot lash. The\nold man ran away and joined a circus in his youth,\ncombed the prima donna\u2019s hair, assisted the lion-tamer,\nwas brought back home, and locked in the cellar for a\nperiod of four months. There, among the rats, mould\nand dungeon-dampness he learnt how to use a whip; the\nringmaster of his own longings could eventually, at the\nheight of his career, kill a fleeing rat, or a squirrel in the\ntop of a birch tree, and soon he forgot about lions and\ntigers and concentrated on rats and young squirrels.\nGenerally liked for his stupidity, generally admired for\nhis cruelty, generally respected for his wealth, he\ngradually acquired the biggest collection of whips in the\ncountry.\n\n\u2018Get undressed,\u2019 his father now ordered the boy,\n\u2018take everything off, put your clothes on the fur rug,\nbend over like the miserable wretch you are, legs\nslightly apart, back towards the door, head as near the\nground as you can, your mane should be hanging down,\nso that you look like a lion.\u2019\n\nHe unwinds the endlessly long whip, turns the key\n\n14\n", "one more time in the lock; the terrified footsteps of the\nservants can be heard tip-tapping on the floor outside.\nThen a minute\u2019s silence, and suddenly the carts start\nrumbling through the archway, horses neigh, a coach-\nman is singing some song or other, the thong creeps\nslowly over the floor like a snake as it approaches the\nterrified boy, whose body is as white as ivory. Then the\nthong rises in response to its owner\u2019s command, wraps\nitself gracefully round a silver candelabra, and hurls it\nviolently across the room.\n\n\u201cStand still now, hands on knees, stretch your back so\nthat I can get in better lashes.\u2019\n\nNow the whip swishes across the room again, and\nsuddenly, from the boy\u2019s shoulder diagonally across his\nback and down towards his left hip, it has dug a red\ncanal across the expanse of white desert.\n\n\u201cOne for your damned worrying. Worrying is an\nunclean occupation, best suited to monks, paupers,\nswine and subalterns. But when you have plenty of\nwine, whips and horses, it\u2019s a sin to worry. Think about\nhow well your wine\u2019s tickling your palate - if it doesn\u2019t,\nchoose another wine. Feel how comfortably the whip\nfits into your hand \u2014 if it doesn\u2019t, get a carpenter to\nmake a new handle which suits you better. Horses run\nfast, if one falls it\u2019s his own fault, there are plenty more.\nNever have pity, it only makes you look foolish and\ntakes up valuable time; kick the horse up its backside\nand make yourself respected.\n\n\u201cOne for all your damned prattle about feeling guilty.\nGuilt is just for the weak, that\u2019s what they\u2019re there for.\nSit comfortably in the dress circle and watch how they\ngo about their puppet-lives, they generally act for\nmoney, the director might well be a brother-in-law.\n-Don\u2019t join in the play-acting, just sit and watch for as\n\n15\n", "long as you find it amusing. People don\u2019t expect you to\ndo anything in this big farce of a life, and if they do, then\ndisappoint them.\n\n\u2018One for your damned youth, but you'll get over that.\n\n\u2018One in the hope you'll get over it as soon as possible.\n\n\u2018One for every horse you'll ride till it drops in the big\nwild boar hunt next October, and laugh at like all the\nrest of us.\u2019\n\nThen the boy slowly collapses, the network of canals\nacross his back is slowly filling up, the whole world is a\nbow] of whip-lashes joined together, the fur rug closes\naround him, its smell of bear\u2019s blood has breathed its last\nafter all the years, now it smells of cigars, spilled\nwhisky, mistresses\u2019 perfumes. Minutes pass and the boy\ndoesn\u2019t wake up, hours pass and the boy doesn\u2019t wake\nup, years pass: there\u2019s still no sign of him. Then he\nsuddenly finds himself, time has rushed by, he\u2019s a boy no\nmore, his back feels a little sore when his jacket rubs\nagainst it, when he puts his shirt on or takes it off, but\napart from that he\u2019s no doubt completely restored. His\nfather\u2019s got older, shrunk somewhat, and leans forward\nat a frightening angle when he walks; his mother, whom\nhe hardly noticed before, is always at the stove\nnowadays with red peppery eyes, or lying on the sofa in\nthe hall with some secret pains. Yes, it\u2019s true: the castle\ndisappeared as well; according to his father speculators\nand profiteers were in league, their finances collapsed,\nfirst all the horses were sold, land followed a bit at a\ntime, the servants were sent packing, but nothing helped.\n\nNow all three walk these grey streets, bowed under\nthe yoke of dreams and hopeless expectations. Take the\nold man, for example: every evening when it\u2019s suffici-\nently dark, he sneaks up into the attic of the old block of\nflats, and all alone with a length of strong cord and a\n\n16\n", "broken fishing rod he revives his old whip-dreams.\nOtherwise, he\u2019s broken with the past: now he hangs\naround one of the four pubs in the area for half the day,\ngrumbles away about politics in rather a loud voice,\nfrequently writes letters to newspapers about the local\ndogs, and apart from that there\u2019s most probably no one\nwho knows how he feels.\n\nHis mother\u2019s in a pitiful state. No doubt it irritates\nher to find the only thing she has to throw at the\nrampant cats copulating in the back yard in March are\nbundles of old correspondence from the castle.\n\nAnd Lucas himself? As noted, the scars from the\nlashes get a little bit sore, but who can say why the park\nstill keeps cropping up in his nasty dreams? When he\u2019s\nworking at his desk in the suburban bank, he often sees\nits contours in bits of the wall where the paint is flaking\noff, and the pony often emerges from some crack or\nother. Is the guilt still there, will it go on for ever? The\ncircumstances change; if you're sitting on a log making\nmusic and somebody's lying trapped underneath it,\npractically unable to hear, it might seem a simple\nmatter to do your duty, get up and roll the log away.\nBut if the one on the log\u2019s young, he\u2019s often told by the\nothers who are used to sitting up there that the slightest\nlittle movement can cause the whole building - sym-\nbolically speaking, it\u2019s true, but even so \u2014 to collapse.\nBetter to tune your instrument and blow hard so that his\nmoans are drowned; perhaps the poor creature trapped\nunder the log and supporting the whole system can get\nsome pleasure out of the concert. Poking around a bit in\none of his ears, so that the music can get through more\neasily, is the best you can do to help without risking\nyour own skull being smashed in.\n\n- If you\u2019re young, then, and rather soft-centred, as\n17\n", "Lucas was at the time, for instance, you think you\u2019re\nduty-bound to stay on the log; if you move slightly the\nwhole world trembles ominously, the baying of the\ninstrument and the red, puffed-out cheeks of the player\narouse both disgust and despair, the feeling of helpless\nguilt is almost overpowering. Then you may get lucky,\nsomebody presses a recorder into your hands, soon you\nlearn which holes to cover and how to blow, and soon\nyou find your own spiral staircase in oblivion\u2019s mansion\nof notes, and soon you're sitting of your own free will\non that fatal log, conjuring up the little temple of\nsymbolism and adding on ornamentations of your own.\nYou hang up your guilt on the highest point of the gable\nend like a silly little tin souvenir of your childhood. But\nit was a bit different for Lucas, that initial period when\nthe child had stopped jumping about on the log without\nrealizing it, the time of inhibitions and guilt: fear of the\npark, the death of the horse and the gardener\u2019s children,\nit all held him in a vice-like grip \u2014 but the whip came\nand set him free after all; the little flute flourished fora\nwhile in his hands, but it didn\u2019t sound quite right even\nso, the undertone of fear, guilt and bitterness was rather\nshrill and was noticed by the family. Just when his\nfather had been practising with his whip enough to\ndrive the last remains of his disobedience out of his\nbody, however, came the crash, the log rolled slowly\nover, and now they were lying underneath it them-\nselves, gasping in terror for breath. But Lucas - did it\nhappen as one has a right to expect, did his silent\nconscience do an about-turn and start protesting bitterly\nagainst those who were grinding his body down into the\ndust? Before, he'd felt guilty; surely he now felt\nvindicated? But it\u2019s remarkable how lonely Lucas\nalways seemed to be! His new friends who sweated\n18\n", "away in the same room as him ten hours a day and\nsnatched a hurried meal of warmed-up potatoes and\nsoya beans at their desks, afraid that if they didn\u2019t they'd\nhave to stay behind and not get home in time to do the\novertime they had to do in order to be able to afford to\npay for the room where they did the overtime when\nthey weren\u2019t sleeping and in order to be able to buy\nmore soya beans so that they\u2019d have enough strength to\nwork both at home and at the bank; these new friends\nwith bent backs and short laughs who gave off a vague\naroma of lard and not excessively clean socks had no\nsensation of being squashed by logs and being slowly\nserenaded to death by people who were using the logs as\nbenches.\n\n\u201cNever mind, old chap, it\u2019s to do with the air\npressure, it'll soon pass,\u2019 they would say patronizingly\nto Lucas when he tried to spell out how things were.\n\u2018Look, some headache tablets might help.\u2019 They were a\nfriendly bunch, albeit a bit forced in the way they\ndisplayed their sympathy; they had to save time and\nstrength for their work, and tablets always help, of\ncourse. Lucas was confused and swallowed a handful of\nthe evil-smelling oval pills, they irritated his throat like\npepper, and they didn\u2019t help at first; but after a few\nweeks the pressure of the log was no more than that of a\npair of over-short braces against his chest. Well, what\ngood did it do for the guilt to keep on coming back? It\nwas absurd to feel guilty when no one was being\noppressed by him any longer, why should the one lying\nunder the log feel guilt on behalf of the one sitting up\nabove playing the recorder? He read theology at the\nlibrary, but that didn\u2019t get him anywhere. The Chinese\nin China were starving to death in rather large numbers\n\u201cnowadays, and in a Velamese newspaper he read how\n\n19\n", "people in a previously undiscovered country were being\ntortured by bandits, people with unusually grey eyes\nhad them gouged out, for instance, at the whim of their\ncruel masters. Lucas couldn\u2019t do anything about that,\ncommunications alone made any suggestion of inter-\nvening out of the question: journeys cost money for a\nstart, though of course he might be able to steal money\nfrom the bank \u2014 but was it right to put yourself in debt\nin order to be able to help somebody else pay his debts?\nIt\u2019s a hell of a world when somebody gets kicked every\ntime you raise your foot, and someone is crushed every\ntime you put it down again.\n\nLucas worried, and was painfully aware that for\nevery hour that passed, more and more poor people in\nthe Velamesian Republic had their eyes gouged out. He\nexplained his dilemma to all his friends and acquaint-\nances, but they read different newspapers and hence\ndidn\u2019t believe him. And so he took upon himself their\nguilt as well, for somebody had to bear it after all, and\nhis back became bowed because of the weight on his\nshoulders, so that people naturally advised him to do\ngymnastic exercises. One day, however, a very per-\nceptive man who used to prey on schoolmasters\u2019\nwidows, full of cynicism, the only form of wisdom he\ncould still accept, took Lucas by the arm and explained a\nfew facts: for instance, was Lucas in the best position to\nsave those people\u2019s eyes? Those best placed were surely\nthe Velamese themselves, and then, if one thought of\nVelamesia as the middle point of an enormous circle\nwith Lucas wandering about on its periphery, between\nhim and all its horrors were gigantic segments of guilt-\nladen silence, and between Lucas\u2019s world and the\nVelamesian crimes was a wall of people as high as the\nskies, like a fire break, and it was the same no matter\n\n20\n", "which way he turned. Of course, the whole business\nwas messy \u2014 but if that\u2019s how things were? Moreover,\nsomething had happened at the bank: worried by the\ndeterioration in his performance at work, or as they\npreferred to put it: his excessively pallid appearance,\npossibly due to a change of air, he was called before the\nmanagement of the bank and requested in clear enough\nterms to sort out the reasons for his indisposition, or\nface dismissal.\n\nPressed between the cardboard partition of guilt and\nthe iron wall of existence, therefore, he chose remark-\nably enough to push back the former in order to create\nroom for his body. As if by coincidence, the wounds he\nthought had healed long ago opened up again, and he\nwas obliged to walk carefully and avoid exposing\nhimself to any kind of risk. Fire breaks shot up around\nhim, in fact, enclosing the world. Together with a\nfriend from the bank, he would go out on certain\nSundays and public holidays to a beck on the outskirts of\nthe town and fish for a species of tiny trout, which were\nbarely big enough for a single breakfast. There on the\nboggy banks of the fast-flowing beck, Lucas appreciated\nfor the first time the meaning of a life without guilt.\nLucky enough to be born with fire breaks in most\ndirections, he felt himself obliged to enjoy his situation\nfor as long as it lasted. Incidents like the gouging out of\neyes in Velamesia were bad enough, it\u2019s true, but they\nwere no doubt only made worse by irrelevant lament-\nations; and obvious injustices nearer home were just as\nlittle to do with him, for wasn\u2019t it also unjust\nfundamentally to let one\u2019s attitudes be governed by\ngeographical considerations? Being doubly careful to\ntake into account all parties concerned as well as\n\n21\n", "himself, and to ensure that no injustice befell those who\ncraved sympathy, there was clearly no better way than\nleaving everything well alone, including those who\nwere suffering, because if you really had to spell it out,\nwasn\u2019t guilt merely another word for a lack of\nconcentration? If you acted in response to your guilt,\nwell, how many people would get kicked over every\ntime you moved your foot, and how many people were\ngoing to feel delighted when your guilt picked out some\nobjects and not others? Wasn\u2019t it best, not least out of\nconsideration for others, to avoid having any views at\nall on the vices of the age?\n\nHis work output began to increase slowly, and note\nhow he adopted a delightful handwriting style, artist-\nically ornamented; no more than a glance at his lace-\nlike S was needed to convince the management at the\nbank that he\u2019d be a faithful servant until he died of\nconsumption due to unsatisfactory ventilation at his\nworkplace. Something of himself, it might even have\nbeen most of him, flowed from his nib as he wrote the\nmost trivial things, and he acquired a remarkable urge\nto draw diagrams: he'd portray Sunday\u2019s trout and his\neveryday walk to the bank in the form of delicate curves\non graph paper; in his own way he was no doubt typical\nof an age which stole its own agony: you'd stand in the\nmidst of the black throng like a pickpocket, slipping\nyour hand into your own pocket and grabbing the evil\nthing. Then it was time to play the double role of the\nperson robbed, and you always tried to let your torment\nslink into another pocket, another person\u2019s pocket. But\nall too often your lack of dexterity led to your choosing\nthe wrong pocket, and it was annoying when you came\nback home with a hip pocket swollen up like an\nenormous abscess, and the thief-victim was nearly\n\n22\n", "exposed as a result of his mistake; finger exercises were\nthe only hope, in fact.\n\nBut one day the letter comes even so. It\u2019s standing on\nthe shelf over the stove when he comes home one\nevening, like a white, menacing shadow. He sees it\nimmediately, no doubt, but first he has something to eat\nand pretends he\u2019s not seen it; he builds tunnels of prawn\nshells on his plate, and covers the openings with potato\npeel, not that it helps. With his knife of fear and his\nsharp conscience-fork, he presses hard and scrapes the\ngrey china, and the gilded layer of duty slowly starts\nflaking off; he looks into his mother\u2019s eyes and they are\nfestering, the skin is stretched tightly across the bones of\nher face, the little triangular room seems to be\ncompressing all their thoughts, hopes, imaginings and\ndesires into disgusting triangles. Ah, now he feels he\nwants to emerge from this prawn-shell and potato-peel\ntunnel which is set to enclose him for ever. He begs of\nhis knife: cut through my woollen layer, the gilded\nsurface of my nakedness; and of his fork: pierce my\ncontentment and my unscrupulous diagram-poisoning\nwith your silver claws.\n\nHurriedly, he picks up the letter, opens it, reads it and\nshouts: \u2018I have to leave!\u2019\n\nBut his mother has realized that and she\u2019s already\npacked; he picks up his suitcase without even deigning\nto give her one last look, echoing up the staircase he can\nhear his father\u2019s whip, newly bought with money\nintended for food, clicking its tongue down in the\nvaulted cellar. He starts running, and his ear is almost\ntorn off by a lash from the whip.\n\n\u2018Father!\u2019 he shouts, \u2018I have to leave.\u2019\n\nThe whip falls silent.\n\n* \u2018Why?\u2019\n23\n", "\u2018I\u2019ve had a letter. It says I have to go to a certain\nmeeting-place.\u2019\n\n\u2018Something to do with the bank?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, I have to leave everything behind. It\u2019s time\nsomething I failed to do ages ago is finally put right.\u2019\n\n\u2018Stay where you are and don\u2019t move.\u2019\n\n\u201cYes, Father.\u2019\n\nAnd it\u2019s the same moment as once before, the whip\nseems to be the same in any case, no, not quite, maybe\neven more savage and bloodthirsty. Lucas collapses now\non to the cellar passageway, all the walls between then\nand now have crumbled, the concrete cellar floor fades\naway and in its place, the soft pelt of a bear rises up, he\nburrows down into the fur rug and knows he will stay\nafter all.\n\nHe gets up and wanders back up the stairs, and behind\nhim the whip suddenly bursts out laughing as it comes\ninto sudden contact with a cellar wall, his mother\nunpacks again, he sees how she hides the only suitcase\nunder a pile of bank journals in a wall cupboard. They\ngo on eating in silence, and everything is just as it has\nbeen for a long time: family happiness, and the greasy\nsmell of cooking and mixed perfumes from mouldy\nwallpaper waft once more through the room.\n\nNow time passes quickly once more, columns and\ntrout intertwine to form fences round his life; to be\nsure, he notices the black car following him as he walks\nhome in the afternoon, it keeps flashing its lights, and\nthe man who bundles him in through the back door is\nsomehow familiar. They drive out into the desolate\ncountryside, and by a bridge with a single silvery\nlamp is an old man playing his fiddle in the middle of\nthe night, his instrument case lying open to receive\ncontributions; suddenly the car skids and crushes the\n\n24\n", "case under a front wheel. They hear the shouts behind\nthem, but gaze down into the darkness under the bridge\nwhere the lights on a barge are threading their soft\nstrands through the mists over the water. Lucas is sitting\nin the back seat squashed between two hefty men with\ntesty voices; they don\u2019t need to guard him so keenly, no\none needs to worry about Lucas making a run for it; his\nfirmly laced-up will can be moulded gently by any hand\nthat cares to try, any move from his side will only make\nan even bigger mess of things, he knows that.\n\nWhere are they going? He\u2019s completely calm and has\nno expectations - what is there for him to hope for any\nmore? \u2014 and he listens to the big car roaring into the\nsilence of the night; sometimes farm carts stand sleepily\nat crossroads, their shafts bowed; terrified cows woken\nup by the car\u2019s engine scramble in vain to get up on their\nknees as the headlights catch them; rather less noisily\nthey purr on to a bumpy, crooked side-road where the\nheadlights crash repeatedly into oak trunks or bob over\nlittle black, scared ponds. Grass is growing right down\nto the edge of the road and sways gently as if the\nheadlights were a breeze, and now he recognizes where\nhe is, but without any great feelings of fear or surprise:\nthe path and the oak forest of his childhood have found\nhim again, and the pony also appears as they round a\nbend, as if emerging from a dream; it still hasn\u2019t moved\nsince it fell, and in the sharp beams before the car brakes\nto a halt, the bodies of millions of ants glisten like a\nnetwork of neon lights stretched over the body of the\npony, which is still not quite dead.\n\n\u201cGet out,\u2019 says the gardener\u2019s son, one of those sitting\nat his side throughout the long journey and smelling of\ncigars, a podgy man approaching middle age with\nflabby folds in his face; the woman sitting beside the\n\n25\n", "driver is his sister, the one who\u2019s been hunched over a\nlocal map all the time and wearing a transparent\nmourning veil; she glances up and then gets out on to the\npath. Lucas walks quickly past her, and can hear her\nbreathing behind the veil.\n\n\u2018That\u2019s enough,\u2019 she whispers. \u201cGet down on your\nknees.\u2019\n\nHe sinks slowly down in front of the dead horse, his\nlegs telescope together as if pressed by an unseen hand,\nthe car lights go out, it suddenly swivels round on the\npath with a snarl and is sucked into the darkness under\nthe trees. Is the woman still there? His ears grope\naround helplessly and return empty-handed, and witha\nsob of loneliness he stretches himself out beside the\nhorse and reaches out his arms to draw it towards him.\nBut by then it\u2019s disappeared, as you might expect, and\nthere\u2019s just a hollow lying by his side, a grave with the\noutline of a horse five times blacker than the darkness;\nthat\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to caress in all his isolation, and\nsomething sucks his body slowly over the edge, his head\nis pulled gently like a barge falling slowly down into the\ndepths, indeed, the fall is incredibly slow. Doubled up\nlike a foetus, his body sinks downwards, his hands, those\nwhite feelers, are quivering in expectation of touching\nthe rough skin, but instead, the white wave rises up\nfrom the bottom and wafts over him like a light breeze.\nProtecting himself, flapping around like a swimmer is\nof no avail, he\u2019s preparing to choke and opens himself up\ncompletely so that the wave can engulf him, when he\nrealizes that nothing can happen, not a single drop has\nflowed into his mouth, no, the wave wraps itself around\nhis body like a silken sheet and although his body\nsuddenly turns into a gigantic tongue wriggling like a\nsnake in an attempt to capture a little dampness, the\n\n26\n", "result is ill-fated. Meanwhile he goes on sinking, and\ntempting smells rise up towards him from the distant\ndepths: ambergris and gin, the scent of birdsong over a\nbubbling spring, the broken clinking of a wine cellar\u2019s\nchill, the hard smell of metal and poverty from a brass\nwater tap, nothing will be missed, everything pierces\nhis heavy body like sharpened drills, and when he\u2019s\nendured everything, the dead horse is still lying there\ndumbly at the bottom, and even the ants can be seen\nthrough the water: he\u2019s possessed once again by rage;\nnow he understands the horse\u2019s cruel role as an agent of\ntorture, it\u2019s lying on the bottom of the well of his thirst,\nand all the scents of pain are rising from its skin. His\nfingers are hooked voraciously as he hurls himself upon\nthe horse and digs his sharp nails into its soft flesh like\nneedles, his caresses are long since forgotten, now all he\nwants is bitter revenge.\n\nWith his hands buried deep down in the sand, he\nslowly emerged from the gigantic parcel of his dream\nwith the seventy seals, a worthless little kernel in the\nlast and smallest box of the hundred boxes that are his\ndream; he rolled over on his back, groaning, his mouth\nwide open and desperate to catch the insubstantial rain.\n\nBut like balloons in spring, the grey tufts of dawn\nwrenched themselves loose from the fold of the sea, the\nemerging contours of the island and the wreck\u2019s\nshattered masts, the liana-like confusion of rigging and\nthe explosion of anchor cables, rose directly into the\nskies, whose loosely draped silken screen was suddenly\nflung aside and stretched tightly as ice; it was inadequate\nto cover the whole space, and from some of the gaps\nlight oozed forth like apple juice and poured into the\nsea, which was consumed in turn as darts of golden\nflame licked the shiny black expanse like the tongue of a\n\n27\n", "hungry dog. The green silk of dawn was now snipped\naway at the edges by the scissors of new light, slits\nappeared, and pieces of grey mist were set ablaze as\nlight came plunging down; a bloodshot gigantic eye\nblinked momentarily, then the whole sea burst into\nflames and bobbed against the eastern horizon like a\nfisherman\u2019s float in the early morning.\n\nTo Lucas Egmont it was all one long fall; still\nyawning wide, he tried scrambling to his feet, but\ncouldn\u2019t manage it until his speed of fall diminished.\nSwaying to and fro, pains shooting through his legs and\nhis throat still twitching in response to the water of his\ndream, he stood there in the sand; his canvas shoes\nsqueaked every time he moved a muscle and the rubbing\nof sand under his finger-nails made him feel sick.\nIntoxicated by the certainty of his fate, he staggered\nforward to the water, sunk to his knees by the lagoon,\nand thrust his fingers violently into the cooling water;\nsomeone was hanging like a dead weight round his\nshoulders, someone was pressing down on the back of\nhis neck, the urge to dive in became almost irresistible,\nhis lips were drawn to the water like a magnet, his face\ncame nearer and nearer to the surface and his jerky\nreflection rose from the bottom of the lagoon.\n\nFragments of his dream were bobbing about on the\nwater, he sank to his knees and relived everything that\nhad happened in his dream. Meanwhile the red float -\nsplashed with the blood of the giant fish - gradually rose\nup from the sea with meticulous care, as if the invisible\nfisherman were trying to do all he could not to scare his\nprey. Thirst, thought Lucas Egmont, all is thirst. Guilt,\nfear, all aspects of guilty conscience, cruelty and lies,\nit\u2019s all thirst; flight and degradation, desires and social\naspirations, everything is merely thirst.\n\n28\n", "Forced slowly on to his back by all his certainties, he\nwatched as the sea was suddenly stretched like a fire\nblanket and formed a vast blue stillness under the\nbalancing act of the sun, which was still standing on the\nground, red and bulky, gazing at the ladder and the\nrope. Thirst, he thought, around which everything\nrevolves, the only firm point in a slack universe: where\nwould we be without thirst - like a helpless guest\ninvited to a dinner for the first time, not knowing what\nto do with his hands in an overwhelmingly big hall?\n\nBecause, he thought, because thirst is the only\ncertainty, I can live a little longer: but not in order to\nslake it, no, to keep it going since if I lose my thirst -\nthen what?\n\nAnd between dawn and morning, the dreamer within\nus, the greatest cynic of them all, helped him to mount\nfast horses and run away from everything which had\nbeen chasing him up to now: his guilt from the castle\nand the bank, his fear of everything which might force\nhim to act, guilt feelings about his flight into the world\nof diagrams and bewitched trout. What else can you do,\nhe thought, but maintain your thirst? If you want irrele-\nvancies to tear you to pieces, go ahead and drink!\n\nWhite clouds of the only birds on the island, like\nseagulls but with bare necks and red bills made for\nhacking, dumb, and silent in flight, rose up from the\ninterior of the island; transfixed by angst, he recalled\nthose hectic minutes round the buried water keg, the\nshoving, the sharpness of the foot which always kicked\nhim, the supreme moment of satisfaction as his palate\nwas flooded, and the long agony afterwards when\neverything had to be investigated: why had he deceived\nthe bank, shamelessly tricked his employers and fled\nwith the money he'd kept hidden so long? It was like\n\n29\n", "masturbation: an hour of blissful self-abuse, a moment\nwhen everything dissolved into blissful agony, a day of\nregret and furtive reproach.\n\nBut he was the one who could see most clearly what\nwas going to happen, knew the ship coming to rescue\nthem was still in Melbourne or Casablanca: he\u2019d better\nbe spared the shameful period of brooding that followed\nonce he'd slaked his thirst. Trembling in every limb, not\njust from the cold, but also from angst, he scrambled to\nhis feet and tried to suppress the crackling noise coming\nfrom the pieces of canvas round his feet as he walked.\nWas everyone asleep now? Gazing down greedily \u2014 yes,\nlooks like that must be from greed, what else? \u2014 the\nbirds circled around some fifteen feet up, their rubber\nnecks stretched out before them. Yes, all six seemed to\nbe asleep: the three men under a sheet of canvas\nbetween the fire and the white rock, with the mad\ncaptain furthest away, his shoulders hunched contemp-\ntuously even in his sleep, turned impatiently away from\nthe nervous airman, whose heavy frame seemed to be\nlying at attention even as he slept; next to him the giant\nTim Solider, calm and impassive under canvas as if\nrelaxing on the chaise-longue at home with his wife beside\nhim; closely intertwined by the fire under a bale of\ncotton they had managed to salvage lay the young\nEnglish girl, her buttocks constantly quivering, and the\nsturdy red-haired woman, enclosed in a secret no one\nyet knew about; on his own near the water keg the\ncrippled boxer, on his back, motionless, like a champion\ncounted out for ever.\n\nUnaware of committing any sort of crime, driven\nonly by the force which always drove him: the urge to\navoid normal guilt feelings, the only thing which for\nhim could ever justify an action, Lucas Egmont took a\n\n30\n", "plank from one of the wooden boxes and started digging\nin the sand until he heard the dull clang. His terror and\ntriumph combined to fling him to the ground and his\nfingers sped like sand torpedoes over the cool metal of\nthe keg, digging out a hollow for the water under the\ntap, and he was shaking as he unscrewed the tap, forcing\nevery muscle in his body to keep his head still under the\naxe of angst and prevent himself from rolling over and\nsimply drinking. But sand drinks quickly, one enormous\ngulp and it had imbibed all the water from the last keg\nthey\u2019d all helped to roll from the boat that first day\nwhen it was still an adventure, over the whole length of\nthe half-moon-shaped reef, crooking its finger along\nthe distant beach. When he lifted up the keg in his dirty\nhands, it was light and silent, and he buried it along with\nall their hopes of rescue just as the sun placed its foot on\nthe first rung of the ladder and the sea seemed to fill its\nchest with its first breath of morning, the birds were\nswooping down into the forest in eerie silence, and he\ncould hear the thud of an early-bird iguana.\n\nHe went down to the lagoon with his wooden plank\nand hurled it out over the water, which welcomed it\nwith a tender embrace; and then suddenly something\nremarkable happened: the bottom of the lagoon was\nsmooth and yellow and seemed almost to be floating just\nbeneath the painfully clear water, but now a clutch of\nwhite bubbles floated up towards the plank like\nballoons, the sand became agitated, a fish slowly\nwriggled free from its grip, and with one lightning-fast\ntwitch of its tail it launched itself from its hiding place,\nthree feet at least it was from its tail to its shark-like\nmouth, its back covered in horrifyingly sharp, six-inch\nspikes, and with a sickening shudder it crashed into the\nplank, then circled round the lagoon in silence, slicing\n\n31\n", "up the surface with its spikes, before sinking down\nslowly, burrowing into the loose sand, and disappearing\nonce more. For a few seconds, the bottom was murky, a\nfew clouds of froth floated on the water, then suddenly,\neverything was exactly as before.\n\nPale with emotion, as if he had seen a ghost, Lucas\nEgmont staggered backwards - was he afraid of being\nstabbed from behind otherwise? - then raced back to\nthe smouldering fire and threw another branch on to it,\nadjusted the cotton over the English girl\u2019s back as she\nmuttered away non-stop in her sleep, then, feeling a\nlittle calmer, returned to the keg in order to go back to\nsleep under the boxer\u2019s canvas. As he lifted the edge, the\ncrippled boxer said without opening his eyes and barely\nparting his lips: \u2018I saw what you did all right.\u2019\n\nLucas Egmont bent over him till he raised his eyelids\nand allowed his hatred to seep out through the gaps.\nThen Lucas smiled down at the boxer as he untied the\nlaces of his makeshift canvas shoes, since it was morning\nnow, and warm. Still bent over him, he dangled the red\nlaces like a pendulum in front of his eyes. Then the\nboxer closed his eyes like a man slamming a door, a\nshudder crept through him like a snake, and he seemed\nto be sinking although he was still lying there.\n\n\u2018Enjoy your thirst,\u2019 said Lucas Egmont, still smiling.\n", "The Paralysis of Morning\nFor a moment Jimmie Baaz thought his paralysis had\nloosened its grip, his hips became supple and the dull\npain abated, his legs bent once more after years of\nstiffness, he wanted to run away, and he could do so\nonce again. He flung back the canvas and then thought\nhe could hear the stimulating reveille of a drum as his\nfeet thudded quickly and regularly on the hard\nmorning-sand. My God but he felt jubilant! The air was\nmild and cool at the same time, still hard after the chill\nof night, and closed in like leaves around his heat. The\nsun was like a newly painted red croquet ball, resting\nfor a moment almost motionless on the black line, and\nthe silent clouds of birds, splashed from below by the\nred glitter of morning on the sea, hovered over the\nworld like white palm leaves. The path over the cliffs\ncame racing towards him and made merry little leaps\ninto the midst of the newly awakened greenery,\ndiscarded iguana skins on some of the green stones\nglittered like stiff lam\u00e9, and in the high grass where he\nhad never been before he would find a depression\nbetween some hidden stones into which he could force\n- down his body and then abandon himself to eternal\n33\n", "tranquillity. He would have reached the terminus of his\nlong flight, and then it could be closed down as there\nweren't going to be any more travellers. None of the\nother survivors would find him, they\u2019d run around in\nthe thickets shouting eagerly that he must come out,\nthey just couldn\u2019t live without him.\n\n*\u2018Couldn\u2019t live\u2019 - oh, he knew full well they only\nwanted to share their own dread of soon having to die\nwith the cripple who couldn\u2019t look after himself.\nThey'd sit there for endlessly long days on end,\ninquiring over and over again in their frightened voices,\nglancing furtively at each other, if he was in pain and if\nhe still wanted to go on living, they were all so very\nkeen for him to be there the day the rescue ship dropped\nanchor in the bay.\n\nThey'd lift off the canvas sheet, and with meticulous\ndignity unwind the rags from both his legs, shattered\nbetween the rocks on the reef and a water keg the night\nof the shipwreck, and they\u2019d nod at him, their faces\ndistorted by optimism and false cheerfulness. They'd\nraise his hand and pretend to take his pulse, although the\nonly heartbeats they could hear would be their own.\nThey'd place their hands on his blood-stained shirt in\norder to feel his heart beating, that is, they wanted to\nconfirm that they were still alive themselves. They\u2019d\ntalk to him about the excellent attention he'd receive on\nboard the ship they were expecting, but only to\nconvince themselves it would come. They\u2019d remind him\nof his times of glory as a boxer, such as that occasion\nwhen he felled three bulls with punches on the piazza at\nGadenia and was honoured with the Empire Medal,\nspeeches by three lord mayors, short films and radio\nbroadcasts, and a maternity home had also been named\nafter him - but they didn\u2019t do this to ease his pain, only\n", "to remind themselves that they weren't abandoned after\nall; they could pretend they were runaway children\nwho are the only ones who think they\u2019re hidden, and\nany minute now their big brothers will be arriving to\ntake them home.\n\nThey'd carefully dip their hands into the drinking\nwater and let him suck their fingers like a calf, and\nwould stick hard crusts of bread or chunks of pineapple\nbetween his lips because they thought: our charity will\nsave us, injustice can\u2019t possibly be so harsh that all this\ncharity will go unrewarded. They were watching him\ndie, of course, and as the days passed they became less\nand less willing to uncover his injured legs; the smell of\ndeath noticed by everyone but himself oozed out of the\ndirty bandages, and their charity became increasingly in\nthe mind, but no less consoling for that. Drowning\nthemselves, they\u2019d watch him sinking slowly like a\nrotten lifebuoy, but still they were cowardly enough to\ncling on to him, thinking: he\u2019s sinking because he\u2019s\nrotten, but we who are unsullied will float thanks to our\nclothes and our own will-power, until someone throws\nus a real lifebuoy. They didn\u2019t need to keep pretending\nthe crippled boxer was in fact the one keeping their\nheads above water, it was just a case of speaking the\nwords of consolation so loudly and so frequently that\nthe cynic inside them could never be heard whispering:\nwhere would we be without our dying, what would be\nthe point of our health without our sick, our happiness\nwithout the unhappiness of others, our courage without\nour cowards?\n\n\u2018Let go of me!\u2019 he longed to cry. \u2018What are you doing\nhere, you hypocrites and water snakes! My misfortune\nis my own, let me die in peace like the rest of you. Why\nshould I be the one to bear all your fear, all your stifled\n\n35\n", "certainty that the rescue ship, as you call it, will in fact\nnever come!\u2019 But he never shouted any such thing, for\nhe was paralysed after all; he\u2019d lain stiffly under the\nwater keg, pressed against the naked rocks of the reef\nlike a beaten wrestler while the long, broken waves\nlashed his body, stamping in the agony; afraid of being\nsucked back down into the precipitous depths, he\u2019d\ntried to cling fast to the rocks with his free hand, and as\nblood gushed out of his tattered fingers he could feel his\nlife coming and going, sliding out of him and shuffling\naway over the slippery rocks before having second\nthoughts and creeping back again. He remembered\ndefending himself desperately every time their octopus-\nlike grip tugged at him anew. He\u2019d tried to kick his\nrescuers with his useless legs when they rolled the keg\naside and dragged him over the rocks by his shoulder,\nbut although he aimed blows at them and struggled with\nall his body to wrench himself away, his attempts to flee\nwere in vain. He hung in their voracious hands like a\nmorally indignant, stolen parcel, and allowed himself to\nbe rescued on to this cruel island which had surrep-\ntitiously clamped its gentle jaws round all their necks\nlike the strands of a man-eating plant.\n\nFull of agonized longing, he\u2019d gazed down like a bird\ninto the overturned well that was the world, with the\nhorizon as the dividing line between the wall of the sea\nand the sky. If the ship had appeared after all,\neverything would have been lost and yet saved, his\nflight would have failed even more pitifully than ever,\nand as good an opportunity as this would never come\nagain. But his paralysis had betrayed him, it told him he\nwould never be able to flee unless his legs could carry\nhim away to the deep hole under the grass and away\nfrom the people roving about on the shore, the ones who\n\n36\n", "were sucking out his own pain, Death, he sometimes\nthought; but death, said his paralysis, death isn\u2019t the\nsame as running away, death isn\u2019t really running away,\njust a continuation of the ultimate angst. Everything\nwould have to be cured if he were to be able to flee. But\nthey all had claws, everybody\u2019s nails were growing and\nno one thought of ripping them off now, and they were\nkeeping watch on him, obsessed with the hope of\nrescue, obsessed with the hope that he would soon die;\nwe're healthy and therefore we'll survive, we're alive\nbecause we're healthy and have enough strength to wait\nfor the rescue boat.\n\nAre there no cracks in their compact dream? Oh,\nhow he tried to grope his way around those white\nsepulchral walls in search of secret cavities, but he was\ntoo weak, too crippled, too isolated in himself. Then\none morning, when they\u2019d all gathered round him again\nwith their commiserations and their chilly angst, he bit\nhard into the hand of the artillery captain, Wilson, who\nwas feeding him crumbs of ship\u2019s biscuits with the\ncynical patience of an animal trainer. He remembers\nhow the hand, already on its journey to death, with\nragged blue fingers where the flesh was glowing hard\nand red in deep hollows, hovered temptingly above his\neagerly open mouth, whose lips always curled to forma\nring without his being able to prevent them. The sea\nbelow them was like the giant black wall of a gasometer\nand the sand seemed to be crunching under the feet of\nsome unseen rambler, while the sky itself was as blue as\nmetal, seemingly bowed under the weight of some\nunknown force: only the powerful columns of their will\nkept them up. Then, just before he bit, clouds of birds as\nwhite as snow seemed to emerge from the captain's\n\n\u2018shoulders, their cruel beaks, with small drops of\n37\n", "congealed blood seeming to hang from their vicious,\npincer-like tips, were pointing steadily down; it was\npainful enough to feel, as it were, the pecking which\nwould sever the ailing flesh from his bones, skilfully and\ntriumphantly. Then he shuddered with horror as he\nnoticed the self-satisfied red spot on the end of the\ncaptain\u2019s nose acquiring a life of its own, just as vicious\nand ruthless as the beaks in the air above, and when he\nlooked slowly round, he saw that all the people\nencircling him had identical spikes of blood pointing\ndirectly at him. Scared, but also determined to break\ndown once and for all the secret door behind which\ntheir secret hopes were hiding, he first closed his eyes in\nreadiness for the preposterous happening; he suddenly\nfound himself shut in a blood-red cave dotted with\nstalactites, filled with forgotten, hushed, primitive\nmusic; the stalactites dug their long fingers into his soft\nbeing and seemed to resound with furious whispering.\nThen, in order to free himself at last from this horrific\ncompany, he tensed himself like a catapult, oblivious to\nhis paralysis, but all he could manage was a weak thrust\nwith his upper body; even so, it was so high and so\nunexpected that he was able to dig his teeth into the\ncaptain\u2019s hand, just under the knuckle of his thumb. He\nbit as hard as he could, dragging the hand with him as he\nfell back on to the sand.\n\nNow he expected a violent outburst, a powerful,\nspiteful blow across his cheek which would have\nreleased him from any form of obligation to suppress\nthe truth \u2014 but the captain\u2019s face and his nose with the\nfierce red spot merely sank down towards him, and the\ncircle of the doomed closed in on him. Smiling\nconfidently the captain slowly coaxed his hand out of\nhis grip, slowly straightened his back and, half turning\n\n38\n", "towards the circle of onlookers, raised his hand towards\nhis heart, as if it had been a medal. All that happened\nwas a regretful shrug of the shoulders; then the circle\ndissolved and he tried to flee and flee, but in vain, as\nthey always came back and kept him paralysed with\ntheir watchful charity. The fear of death, now growing\nby the hour, seemed to envelop them all as they sat\nbeside him wearing their cosmetic masks of clay; they\nhardened in the hot sun, and every quick, fearful smile\nleft behind a battery of creases and furrows; these faces\nlooked like a ghastly ruined landscape in what had once\nbeen beautiful countryside as they bent over his:\ncurious, frowning uncomfortably, inquiring anxiously,\nhalf triumphant in advance or merely riddled with\nterror, whenever they thought he was asleep or had\nfallen into terminal unconsciousness. Worst of all was\nthe young English girl who lay down beside him,\nslender and gazelle-like, her thin birch-leaf fingers\nfrequently fluttering about his face; eyes increasingly as\nfixed as frozen lakes in the snowy landscapes sur-\nrounding her pupils examined him meticulously, and\ninterpreted every change of expression with remarkable\nrapidity.\n\n\u201cYou want something to drink now,\u2019 she would say\nimmediately - or, \u2018Now you'd like to get rid of this\ncanvas sheet for a while.\u2019\n\nShe spoke his language, slowly, darkly, with strange\npalatizations, almost like a tropical negress. It would\nhave been touching and loveable in normal circum-\nstances, but now he found it extremely distasteful,\nanother stage in the process of stifling imprisonment.\nThe girl\u2019s peculiarities forced their way under his hard\nshell of resistance and scratched like a grain of sand,\nmore irritating than the others\u2019 easily exposed charity\n\n39\n", "born of fear, since he detected a comical genuineness\nabout the girl as she lay beside him; at first it seemed\nboundlessly ridiculous, but soon it became painfully\nintolerable as it immediately made everything so\ncomplicated, even more so than the hypocrisy of the\nothers hindering his flight. Aha, a Florence Nightingale,\nhe thought contemptuously, and made himself extra\nheavy when she came with her thin hands and tried to\nchange the rags wrapped round his filthy lower body,\nHe could see point in annoying her as she didn\u2019t possess\nthe honourable falsehood characteristic of all her\nshipwrecked companions. She was genuine, that is, she\nconsidered herself to be genuine, and so her lies were all\nthe greater.\n\nShe would lie down beside him, and they often\nwatched the velvet ships of the clouds gliding majesti-\ncally over the sea. The new line running from the\nblood-red corner of her mouth grew severe and deep,\nand the fine, blue bow of her temples was ready to snap\nat any moment; her frozen gaze suddenly thawed, she\nseemed to reach out for him even though she was lying\nthere without moving.\n\n\u2018Can you see it?\u2019 she said in his language, trembling\naway in the parcel of cloth her body was encased in,\n\u201cThere goes the good ship Tong, with its masts lost in the\nmists. Can you see the captain, the one standing\nsmoking by the rail: the mists come from his pipe. A\nsailor is just emptying a bucket of mist overboard, you\nsee, the Tong would go too fast otherwise. A lady from\nShetland in her phantom fur-coat is evidently not\nfeeling too well, can\u2019t you see how sinister she looks as\nshe stands on deck, waving her white letter of credit?\nThe schoolboy who\u2019s run away from my smoke-\ninfested homeland has just whistled a shrill greeting to\n\n40\n", "freedom, you can see that white column shooting up\nfrom the ship and you probably think it\u2019s the steam\nwhistle, but it\u2019s the boy, I can assure you: his jubilation\nis so boundless that it has to look just like that.\u2019\n\nWith meaningless prattle of that kind in the air, she\u2019d\ngo for a little walk on her own, but Jimmie refused to let\nhimself get carried away; silent and compressed by his\nlonging to run away from it all, his hunger, his thirst and\nhis contempt, he wanted to cry out: \u2018You're lying,\nyou're making up that rescue ship in the clouds, you're\nemptying your heavy box of fear on toa bank of clouds,\nbut keep out of the way when it falls, the floor isn\u2019t very\nsteady. Just wait till my legs have got better and my\nparalysis has eased, there'll be nothing to hold me back;\nI know your fear and your plans for me, but I'll run\naway to where nothing can get at me.\u2019\n\nBut then one day he came to witha start, it may even\nhave been the same day everything else happened, for\nperiods of consciousness in between the darkness of his\noblivion were deplorably short. There was a new\nnuance in her way of talking; it\u2019s possible it had been\nthere all the time, knocking away at his window, but\nnow it suddenly struck him: words that she palatized\nwith the same noble energy as before took on a new\ntenor, and the blue quaking of her thin nostrils also had\nsome message to impart. He lay there with his eyes\nalmost closed and seemed to hear or see nothing, but in\nfact he was observing everything she did with intense\nconcentration; at first he was put out, but increasingly\nhe was filled with disgust and despair as he saw the love\nfor himself that glinted like SOS signals behind her\nevery movement and every word. She turned bravely\naway from him, but even so he could see her face\nmuscles twitching with a desire to turn and face him,\nand tear down all the curtains of modesty.\n\n41\n", "\u201cNow I\u2019m standing there on the upper deck with my\nwhite suitcase. I\u2019ve been sailing on board the Tong for a\nlong time, just wandering all over the boat like a lost\nsoul, waiting eagerly and nervously for my friend. I was\nwandering about like that when we nudged the Antilles,\nand almost touched the Hebridean Isles; it\u2019s been foggy\nall the time, you see, and we've only been able to follow\nthe route on our maps. So there I am on the upper deck,\nwith no idea of what I\u2019m going to do. We keep coming\nacross other boats, little round dinghies in the mist,\nwrapped ina froth of cigar smoke, but also whalers still\nengulfed in the remains of the smoke from the phantom\nwhale that\u2019s now dead. I wave sadly at them, but they\ndon\u2019t notice me because I\u2019m so alone. Then you\nsuddenly come along. Can you see yourself up there\nunder the golden crown? You've been looking for me,\nno doubt, and like a Cassandra, I run towards you to tell\nyou all the things that are going to happen to us. And\nthen the accident happens, you can see up there what\u2019s\nhappened, can\u2019t you? I\u2019m so eager I simply drop my\nsuitcase, the one I\u2019ve been lugging around with me all\nthe time since we left port, the whole voyage; it slides\naway over the deck, which is very slippery, and as it\u2019s\nnot locked, it comes open and everything falls into the\nsea before we know where we are. You can see the\ncontents streaming down into the sea, can\u2019t you? That\nhaze of fiery smoke floating slowly down towards us,\nthat was the contents of my suitcase. \u2014 You can be really\nawful.\u2019\n\nOh, what wouldn\u2019t he have given for healthy, mobile\nlegs so that he could run away from this deceitful but,\nto make matters worse, quite honourably intended gush\nof words entangling his desire to flee in the blind\nthreads of the drifting mist! But he was crippled, albeit\n\n42\n", "only temporarily, and as the pain kept on growing in his\nchest, his ankles, his pulse and his temples, he was\nconfronted by his paralysis every time he tried to turn\nover in the dry sand, which merely wailed plaintively\nby way of reply under the canvas sheet. He had to stay\nwhere he was, but flee even so - the cripple\u2019s dilemma.\nHe must get rid of her, the only one who, thanks to her\nlack of calculation, her unselfish desire to see him\nremain alive, was still able to make him want to stay\ninstead of running away - and he didn\u2019t want to be\nconvinced that running away never does any good, or\nthat there can ever be anything to justify staying\nbehind. To call off a flight that\u2019s already begun is a\nhorrifying undertaking; the moment when the brakes\nare applied is always a millstone round one\u2019s neck, and\neverything pitches into the person trying to run away\nlike a pack of heavy, savage dogs, trampling over one\u2019s\nbelly and tearing at one\u2019s body until one\u2019s guts are\nexposed.\n\n\u2018If you think I can love you, you're sadly mistaken,\u2019\nhe whispered softly to her, so that no one else could\nhear. \u2018I\u2019m lying here rotting away, as you well know.\nIt\u2019s sheer torture for you to choose me to fawn on, aman\nwho can\u2019t move from the spot, who can\u2019t even attend to\nhis bodily needs without disgusting himself and every-\nbody else. Why don\u2019t you go straight to the captain,\nthat hunk of muscle: he should be potent enough to keep\nyou happy. But keep me away from everybody\u2019s gaze,\nespecially yours; wrap me up in the canvas as you would\nsomebody who\u2019s dead already, and then pound away at\nmy hidden body as hard as you can, I won\u2019t put up any\nresistance any more, I\u2019m not going to live as you know\nfull well.\u2019\n\ninvoluntarily, he then looked up quickly, past the\n\n43\n", "large, dense, all-too-bright surface of the sea, and his\neyes settled on the cheeky white yachts of the midday\nclouds scudding towards the horizon. Her gaze sank\ndown, and he could see how the ice in her eyes slowly\nengulfed the island that was her pupil, an icy wind\nseemed to blow over her features which suddenly\nstiffened like rifts in a tundra. Then she slowly rose up\nfrom the sand, wrapped up like a mummy in the thick\ncotton, and just then a shriek rang out from the interior\nof the island, quite loud and shrill, but extremely short -\nwas it from some lonely human, or some animal? - but\nthe English girl heard nothing of this, she struck him\nwith the back of her right hand, brown and pitted by the\nsand, struck him four times over his cheek-bone and his\nnose, casually and absent-mindedly, and all the while\nshe was frozen in her pain; it was like a dead body\nraising its hand by mistake, a statue that comes to life -\nand that\u2019s all.\n\nStiff-legged, strangely statuesque, she then walked\nover the sand towards the fire; the cloth round her\ninjured right foot slowly worked loose and trailed\nbehind her like a split-open snake with blood running\nout; she noticed nothing, and spiralled down in front of\nthe fire. They were alone on the beach just then, it was\nas if the world had forsaken them; a lone bird swooped\ndown over the smoke and seemed to drop something\nfrom its beak into the fire. The dull thudding of iguanas\ndrifted over from the rocks, and someone was shouting\nstubbornly from the trees on the highest part of the\nisland; they were evidently still looking for the shriek.\n\nHow the blows helped him to overcome his inner\nparalysis! The world was once again clearly defined in\nits pure malevolence, and remarkably: the hollow in the\nhigh grass, which he could hear snorting up above them,\n\n44\n", "seemed to be moving nearer all the time. His muscles\nwere softened up by the merry hands of invisible\nmasseuses, and all he was waiting for now was the last\nrush of malevolence which would pluck him up from\nout of his trance and fling his body the last few\nremaining paces. He lay there abandoned all night long,\njust as he had done in the afternoon; no one pretended to\nsee him any more, it was now evidently part of their\nplans to let him die in tranquillity, and part of his plans\nas well - their profound malevolence increased his\nchances of fleeing enormously.\n\nNight had fallen, suddenly, black and starless; the\nwhite wings of the birds flashed occasionally like signal\nlights over the sea, which seemed to be smacking its\ngigantic lips, clicking its huge tongue. The dumb birds\nsuddenly acquired voices in the darkness, or was it just\nhis imagination? A gruff, gutteral sound forced out with\ngreat difficulty, occasionally broke through their\nsilence; they didn\u2019t seem to be talking to each other, but\nto themselves. Then the sand suddenly became damp, as\nif someone had been licking it hurriedly; the cold closed\nin like a suit of armour, and the stars lit up as well,\nhorribly high and no longer twinkling, like the pupils of\na fresh corpse.\n\nAnd at dawn, something wonderful happened: Lucas\nEgmont, his bedfellow, rose to his feet with a groan and\ndrowned his false charity in the stream of water under\nthe water keg. Jimmie was so grateful for that: another\nmooring rope had been cut, and now he could rise up\nlike a balloon into silence and solitude. His limbs were\nfilled with painful desire; as noted, he thought his\nparalysis had eased and suddenly found himself running.\nHe felt as if he were swishing through the morning, his\nfeet were like typewriter keys striking the unwritten\n\n45\n", "sand, which had so often been rinsed by the waves; soon\nhe felt the sun on his back, but the sea was not yet\nmelting in the heat, its vast blue expanse still quivered\nafter the night like the back of an impatient racehorse;\nthe dolphins glistened like flashes of lightning into the\nhorizon, the lagoon was as smooth as a millpond as it\nreflected his flight; the ship lay on the belly of the reef,\napparently still whimpering over its broken back, and\nthe masses of seaweed pouring out of the ship\u2019s gaping\nside glistened with moisture; a porthole whose glass was\nstill only half smashed seemed to be weeping darkness\ndown into the blond water. Once again the birds rose\nout of the grass above him; in close formation with only\na wing\u2019s breadth between them, the whole flock soared\nover the lagoon in near silence, only their wing beats\nrustling gently like the leaves of a book being read to\noneself, their reflection skimming improbably lightly\nover the lagoon, and they headed for the ship where\nthey suddenly swooped down. The birds waddled\nunsteadily over the stern deck, and disappeared one by\none into the hull through some hole or other. It would\nhave been very easy now to run halfway round the\nisland and block the way out for the flock with planks or\na piece of canvas, then lie in wait by the portholes\nwhere they might be expected to creep out, stun them\nas they tried to take off \u2014 and there would have been\nenough food for some considerable time to come.\n\nBut Jimmie immediately chose the higher path, and\nflushed with the thrill of his escape, he raced over the\nrocks, iguana skins exploding loudly under his feet; now\nhe was supreme and refused to be surprised when he\nfound that the path over the rocks, covered in sharp\nstones, caused him no pain at all; the iguanas scuttled\n\n46\n", "quickly out of his way, beating their long tails against\nthe stones with sharp cracks.\n\nWhy was he running away? Well, why does one run\naway? Jimmie Baaz had a painful memory he always ran\naway from. He had been chased up long ladders and\ndreamt of being rescued on the last rung, but in his\ndream the ladder had always fallen over pitifully and\nthe swamp had once more wrapped its sticky arms\naround him. In other dreams he was running down the\nlong road leading away from there, but just like at a\nfairground, the pavements were rolling in the opposite\ndirection and so he was drawn inexorably back again.\nHe would tense his body in readiness for an enormous\nthrust which would free him from the iron grip of the\nroad, but everything just seized up. A helpless bundle\nlashed together with the red threads of his own terror,\nhe would wake up in a cold sweat, and it was hours\nbefore he could straighten his twisted limbs properly\nagain. His muscles ached for a long time afterwards, his\npunches became dull and half-hearted, especially the\nleft one which bounced back ineffectively before it had\nreached its target. For fear of tightening up in his\ndream, he would take strong injections the night before\nevery important bout, and sink quickly down into the\ndepths of unconsciousness. But although he was rescued\ntemporarily from his dream, he would be hounded all\nthe more relentlessly while awake by his pursuer; a\ncertain type of person passing him by in the street would\ngive rise to remarkable feelings of alarm inside him,\ncertain streets exuded a certain type of smell which\naffected him just as badly, and if he therefore chose the\nwide, pearl-studded boulevards where people hurrying\npast thrust visiting cards into his famous fists, he might\ncome across some annoying vehicle or an unattended\n\n47\n", "dog which would jump up at him, panting \u2014 and the\nground would give way under his feet as he sank back\nonce more into this bottomless well.\n\nAt the peak of his career, the supreme pinnacle, he\nwas always being exposed just as painfully to his\npursuer\u2019s arrogance; he had conquered almost every-\nthing: the nation had presented him with a house by a\nlake teeming with salmon, a dazzling white villa\nsurmounted by a cupola bearing the national coat of\narms, and moreover surrounded by just as many yards of\nbarbed-wire fencing when the top men of his country\ncame to visit him; but what was the point of it all when\nhe ended up by barely daring to set foot outside the\nfront door? Every little breeze blowing over the great\nlake carried with it his merciless pursuer. The first time\nhe tried out his new boat, he was whipped up into a state\nof fury, ran aground and sank. It might well have been\neasy to die, but even so he allowed himself to be rescued\nbecause during the few seconds he\u2019d been fighting\nagainst death he realized that for someone who\u2019s\nrunning away, it\u2019s just as pointless to die as it is to live,\nand his desperation held him up like a giant float.\n\nThen came the period when he was evidently so great\nthat no one expected anything of him any more; like a\nstar, he was firmly fixed in the firmament and he no\nlonger needed to box - indeed, to do so could be\nharmful to his fame; he was only allowed to perform at\nbig events staged for the imperial family, fighting\nagainst famous, but not too famous boxers, young bulls\nwho had been prepared before the match like noble-\nmen\u2019s shields that are to be broken at a funeral, and\nsuddenly they would collapse under his punches after\nthe stipulated time, But as he crouched in the cave into\nwhich his long flight had banished him, he realized he\n\n48\n", "was in fact less protected than ever and this would be\nthe end of his flight even so; in the innermost of the\neighteen caves forming his escape route, he beat like a\nmadman against the stone walls in an attempt to pass\nfurther, but in vain; and when he tried to withdraw he\nfound the entrance door to the final cave had closed as\nwell. Locked in the vault where the nation kept its\nheroes, he ran around ceaselessly like a squirrel in a\nwheel, while the applause from the stalls and the dress\ncircle bored its way like drills into his brain, heart,\nkidneys. Now he longed for the trapdoor to open, and\nthen the rapid fall to the source of his agony, the green\nswamp of his memories, oh, let the sticky wave of decay\nbreak over him, flow into his throat and lap around his\nlungs, rock him like a swollen corpse in all eternity;\neven the harshest of possibilities now seemed to him\nalmost like paradise - anything but the torture he was\nnow subjected to. Salvation through ignominy was the\nonly possibility, but how could he humiliate himself\nwhen even the slightest error on his part was immedi-\nately excused with reference to his greatness?\n\nThen he made a terrible attempt to prise open the\ntrapdoor himself. During a gala performance, as the\nimperial family were scattering flakes of silver over the\nstage from their box, he suddenly fell headlong and\nstayed down with his head in his hands; indeed, he was\nalmost holding it in his hands like a fruit. Pale with\nemotion, the young boxer who had felled him staggered\nover to the ropes, all the time staring wide-eyed at his\nhands as if they were splashed with the blood of an\nunknown person. The red lamp over the stage was\nsuddenly extinguished, and subdued grey-green light\nfiltered down on to the sacrifice that had been accomp-\nlished. As he waited for the furious yells of disappointed\n\n49\n", "hope to ensue, Jimmie lay prone, although the back of\nhis neck probably trembled a moment in expectation of\nthe sharp blade; but otherwise he awaited the trapdoor\nwith the calm only extreme desperation can give. There\nwas a subdued rustling like the sound of thousands of\nsweet-bags falling, then nothing but a transparent,\ncrystal-clear membrane of silence as the man in the\nwhite coat emerged from the wings and announced\nquietly, like a priest at a funeral: he\u2019s ill, he had a sudden\nattack; I suggest we rise to our feet and give the\nunfortunate man an indication of our appreciation. The\norchestra struck up a patriotic tune, and men picked\nhim up carefully by his limbs, made sure his head was\nstill attached, and then carried him off the stage in time\nwith the music.\n\nHe lay there helplessly in their arms, more cut off\nthan ever before from any possibility of running away\nfrom flight. Then just as the curtains were closing\nbehind him, he heard them giving three cheers for him,\nthe eternal victor who can win everything but defeat.\nOh, how he would have loved to tear himself loose from\nthose sixteen sticky hands and run out on to the stage,\nscreaming out his agony, spraying his angst like an\nuntamed fountain until it swamped the whole world;\nbut all he was still capable of was to twitch a little, a\npitiful death-throe which merely served to make his\nbearers tighten their firm grip.\n\nAh well, as he was ill he was at least allowed to go\naway on holiday. He loved wandering around oriental\nharbours where nobody recognized him, and loved\naccepting the feelings of contempt and disgust directed\ntowards him. Of course, he was never really alone; the\nnation had invisible spies keeping watch on his every\nmove from a distance, but even so, even this form of\n\n50\n", "solitude helped him considerably. He could sink down\nbehind the raffia basket of the snake charmer, close his\neyes tightly and shut out all other noises apart from the\nsoft, velvety rustling from inside the basket and think:\nnow I\u2019m only a Tartar lying here in the heat, far away\nfrom home, to which only a chain of broken horses links\nhim. Or lie in the bottom of a river-barge hung with\nbrocade, like those used by the sailors from Belize, just\ndrifting around in the little harbour; longboats weighed\ndown with small fruits sparkling silver, smelling\nstrangely of caraway and despair, their oarsmen\nshouting merrily, wend their way among rafts bearing\ndrowned sacrificial animals; masses of dead horses were\nalso floating around in the becalmed waters, and on the\nshore clay gods peered from the ape-laden trees;\noccasional music, the lavender beat of a drum spreading\nslowly from the brown, summery huts half-buried in\ngorse, many of them desolated in the latest revolution.\nFrom the bottom of the boat, however, the only view\nwas the silken tent of the bright day, and the many\ndesiccated wisps of grey smoke puffing out from the\nclearings among the cedars. Then he thought: what am I\nbut a drowned man, rescued too late among the horses,\nfloating here for ever without even knowing whose\nbody I am? He was stupefied by the pleasure the thought\ngave him; the swell rolling in from the sea brought\ntranquillity in every wave, and the gentle thuds each\ntime the boat hit a drowned animal spread a feeling of\nwarm well-being throughout his body; life was merely\na sleepy stretch of water into which he\u2019d fallen like a\nraindrop from a cloud. Oh, what bliss to surrender\noneself to a lake!\n\nThen the monsoons came, smoke columns fluttered\nwildly and aggressively like battle standards, and\n\n51\n", "natives in the huts were preparing for slaughter. The\nanimals not yet sacrificed and kept tethered in the cedar\nforests wailed as they were led home, and small, nearly\nnaked boys hung on to the bulls\u2019 horns, shouting away\nand trying to recall the joys of summer, but in vain.\nSoon a blood-stained column of terrified bellowing rose\nup from every hut, a bitter stench gathered beneath the\ntrees, and the natives, rarely visible, clamped their\nhands over their ears at the sight of the stranger,\nscreeching as they disappeared from view.\n\nIt was time to go, that was clear. In a stabilized\npaddle boat he made his way through rough, blue-black\nweather up the coast, with its frightening white sand\nbars extending between land and sea like hyphens. The\nvoyage took three days; the nights were the most\ndifficult, when he was possessed by extreme anxiety\nand frequently thought he\u2019d been swallowed by a\nmonster in whose belly he was now floundering about.\nThe oarsmen he\u2019d hired were deathly silent, and their\nwhite arms swinging to and fro in the darkness hardly\nproved they weren\u2019t in fact dead. He flung himself\ndown and trailed his hands over the side of the boat,\nfilling them with water from the silent sea, and drank\nuntil his tongue swelled with fire. At peace once more,\nhe collapsed into the bottom of the boat; but his old\ndreams of being rocked into silence, unknown to\nanyone including himself, were finished even so.\n\nIn Ronton, the capital, he embarked as a sick\npassenger on a little vessel which was just about to\ndepart ona pleasure trip toa little archipelago far away,\nin among the Bridge Islands. The ship's doctor soon had\nhim on his feet again, it only needed a little blood-\nletting, and protected by the false identity he had\nacquired temporarily, he thought he\u2019d soon be able to\n\n52\n", "recover the peace of mind he\u2019d found during his stay in\nBelize. He borrowed a mirror the last day he was alone\nin the cramped sick bay, stinking of veronal, and\nexamined his face closely in the green light from the\nporthole. Was it not new, was it not the face of another\nman, a face which hadn\u2019t existed previously but had\nbeen born painfully on the bottom of the long, narrow\nboat, cruising among the dead animals in the harbour?\nWhat? Was it possible after all to become a completely\nnew person, to shake off the odious personality one\ncould no longer bear? How he longed for a miracle of\ntransformation!\n\nIn a mood of superior gaiety, he noted how the other\npassengers observed him with sober indifference,\nevidently no one suspected anything; the experience of\nboundless beauty, the sea a well of light and blueness,\nthe horizon a hair-fine thread stretched like elastic by\nthe billowing waves, the yellow, pearl-like balloon of\nthe sky, everything combined to make each individual a\nsolitary and removed for the moment any desire to find\nout more about them. He lay on the after deck in the\nshadow of a lifeboat, listening to people talking, an\ninfectious laugh, or the cook prattling with his parrot:\nbut none of this affected him, he was possessed once\nmore by blissful tranquillity. Not even over dinner did\nhe need to return to the past; when they talked at all,\nthey only discussed new sensations provided by another\nday of their voyage: anew kind of fish had leapt up over\nthe surface from the depths beneath, a reddish star had\nbeen following them all day and seemed to reflect\nsomething in the sea, or a ship had passed uncomfortably\nclose to their own.\n\nThey gradually approached their destination; the\nbrave little steamer chugged away merrily, quite unlike\n\n53\n", "the big greyhounds they'd passed at the beginning of the\ntrip which didn\u2019t dare venture so far out to sea, but a\nlittle work-horse plodding away gamely, straining its\nevery sinew up the hill.\n\nThen he was lying down one day and could feel when\nhe pressed his hands to his eyes that someone was\nwatching him from the side. He looked up quickly: it\nwas only the English miss, slim, always cool no matter\nhow hot the weather, leaning back against the rail and\nwatching him with a remarkable intensity which\nstabbed into his own eyes. He met her gaze, although he\nwas already starting to tremble as he realized with\nacute certainty that all was lost. Eventually, she became\nunsure of herself as well, looked down, kicked a piece of\nrope end towards him, then walked slowly over the hot\ndeck towards the bridge.\n\nHe closed his eyes again and pretended calmly to\nuntwist the little rope and wrap it hard around his\nwrists. He lay there all afternoon and the thumping of\nthe engines seeped into his excessively fast pulse and\nevery time the pain came on he would tighten the rope\nas hard as he could, as if he could strangle what was\ngoing to come anyway. At dinner he sat there trembling,\nwaiting, could hardly eat a thing, replying sullenly and\nmonosyllabically to all the sympathetic questions, and it\nwasn\u2019t until the dessert, as she sat there crumbling a\nrusk over her cream, that she slowly looked up at him\nand said quickly, through clenched lips, stiff and austere\nlike the daughter of a colonel in the colonial army she\nmay well have been: \u201cYou're the boxer Jimmie Baaz,\naren't you?\u2019\n\nOh, what could he say to that? He pushed his chair\nback and jumped to his feet, and tried to deny the\nclaimed acquaintance; but inexorably, it all took\n\n54\n", "possession of him, he was forced down cruelly but\nslowly by a merciless force which affected all parts of\nhis body, he was doubled up by a slow cramp, not even\nhis throat was spared. He wanted to deny it with all the\nvocal resources he could muster, but everything except\na whimper was brutally restrained; exposed to every-\none\u2019s gaze like a dartboard, he slumped back on to his\nchair.\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 he whispered, trying to eat. \u201cYes, yes.\u2019\n\nAll was lost now, once and for all. The voyage had\nlost all its meaning and the destination had never had\nany meaning, he was the kind of traveller who sets off\non a journey in the secret hope of never arriving, just\ntravelling for the sake of travelling, we all know the\ntype. Now the others had him in an octopus-like\nembrace, it seemed to him, and there was no point in\nrunning away. They were crowding round him all the\ntime on deck now; in their way they respected his\nincognito, and would sit silently for ages in his\ncompany, as if just enjoying his presence, sucking out\nhis silence with their voluptuous lips. All he wanted\nnow in his nocturnal frenzy was to get back to Ronton;\nhe was tortured by the slow beat of the pistons which\nkept him awake all night, and when he did occasionally\ndoze off, he dreamt he was a tall giant wading through\nthe sea alongside the boat in rubber boots; the boat was\nalways a paddle steamer in his dreams, and he was\nspinning the paddles round at a tremendous speed with\nhis little finger. Filled with despair, he would then be\nwoken up again by the noise of the engines and the\nnocturnal seas slapping against his porthole. The last\nnight before the shipwreck, he jumped out of his berth\nand raced upstairs on to the deck into the cold dawn,\njust when the moon was speeding up. Everywhere the\n\n55\n", "sea was speckled with white foam, the horizons seemed\nto be raised above the water and hovering loosely\nbetween the sea and the sky before moving in on him,\ndrawn by some unseen hand, and the pressure was\nalready beginning to grow around his head. He flung\nhimself down in his usual place by the lifeboat and his\nfingers started fiddling absent-mindedly with the little\npiece of rope the girl had kicked over to him. Without\nrealizing it, he lay there freezing in the wind at first,\nlistening to the orchestra playing; an iron rod was\nclanging down in the engine room, and the parrot\nseemed to be fluttering around the cook\u2019s cabin.\n\nThen he suddenly felt the rough rope around his\nfingers and pulled it slowly over his chest and up\ntowards his chin. He held his right arm stiffly in the air,\nwatching the rope in horror; some gruesome quality he\nhad only just seen in it put him ina frenzy, he rolled over\non to his stomach and pounded the deck like a man\npossessed. The rope coiled itself before his very eyes,\nno, he couldn\u2019t avoid the rope\u2019s red colour, a red which\nstabbed him from pulse to pulse with a thousand\nconcealed spikes, and howling inwardly, he was flung\nbackwards like a bullet through space, and with a\nmerciless sucking noise the green wave enveloped him\nonce more. He ran from bows to stern, no one was\nallowed near him; the English girl sometimes stood in\nhis way, gazing at him pleadingly. The artillery captain\nwith the big boxer dog, which later drowned, was\nrunning around the after deck in his clattering boots,\nplayfully setting the dog on him while pretending not to\nnotice they existed.\n\nWhen the storm broke, they could see it rising\nsuddenly from the western horizon like a giant bird,\nthen setting course for their ship, faster and faster,\n\n56\n", "spreading its pearl-grey wings wider and wider; a\nleaden cloud hung down from its claws like a stolen\nlamb as it swooped down over them, howling, appa-\nrently intent on hacking them to pieces; just before they\nwere smothered, they could see how one of its wings\ndropped stone-like towards the water, and as if it had\nbeen hit by a shot, blood in the form of a blood-red glow\nwas running down its white feathers and all over them.\nThen everything was compressed into a pitiful mass\nunder the bird, fears and fantasies, happiness, pain,\nmalice and all the other special things; they huddled\ntogether in the shuddering lounge as the panelling\nbulged, and yelled at each other confidential things they\nwould normally only be able to whisper while the\ncaptain\u2019s boxer and Madame\u2019s senile little boy lay\nterrified in a crumpled heap at the top of a staircase,\ntrembling together. Only Jimmie, filled with a disgust\nwhich drowned everything else, was on his own, rolling\nabout on the floor of his cabin.\n\nThe catastrophe saved him, indeed, here was no place\nfor hypocrisy, and the shipwreck actually saved him\nfrom the worst - and now, as he races through the\nisland\u2019s blond morning only a few rocks away from the\nlonged-for hollow which will swallow him up, every-\nthing is childishly simple, like a croquet lawn where\nevery hoop has learnt to obey the swishing of the balls.\nThe sun released its cluster of balloons as it detached\nitself from the sea and lay there shivering half an inch\nover the horizon, metallically yellow but still chilled by\nthe night frost; as he approached rapidly, the bushes\nstirred slightly in the gentle, still-cool breeze the sea\nwas blowing nonchalantly at them, and even before he\ncould see it, the grass was rustling sleepily in front of\nthem. His feet now launched him upwards ina series of\n\n57\n", "little bounces, and ignoring the iguanas slithering over\nthe rocks, he breasted the tape triumphantly as he\nentered the thicket, thrusting the branches effortlessly\naside as if he were diving into water, and suddenly he\nfound himself in the long grass.\n\nHe felt dizzy and stood absolutely still, everything\nwas so fantastically different and his sense of liberation\nenveloped him like a breeze, laden with his own\nwarmth and filled with mysterious scents. Seen through\nthe latticed tips of the grass which was much taller than\naman, the light flowed past like cool, silent streams, the\nwarm shadow of the cathedral pressed gently down\nupon him and he sank slowly to the ground, overcome\nby events. It was windier now, but he felt nothing of it,\nmerely saw it in the grass high above him as the expanse\nof panicles straining towards the sun swayed violently,\nand white butterflies with thin red markings on their\nleft wings bobbed up and down like distressed boats on\nthe elevated ocean. He felt he was lying on the sea\nbottom, no pain touched him any more, no chill cut\nthrough him, no heat attempted to embrace him, no\nhatred flowed over him, no love seemed to scratch him,\nno longing to carve him up.\n\nHe was dragging his fingers over the ground, flat,\nhard, still slightly damp after the night, then suddenly\ncried out in alarm as he came up against an obstacle, and\nwhen he looked down and round about him he realized\nto his indifferent surprise he was already lying in a\nhollow in the ground. The sides were like polished\ncrystal, but the bottom was soft and fluffy, a clump of\nlow grass was waving like a cloud at his feet, weak puffs\nof invisible warmth were blowing down regularly\nbetween the blades of grass and the peaceful church-\nlight was reflected in the oystered edges; yes, this was a\n\n58\n", "hollow for all eternity. He lay there on his back for a\nlong time without attempting to move any part of his\nbody, not even in his mind, as butterflies fluttered lazily\nlike listless sailing boats in the grassy swell above and\nsmall, green insects and small, spherical blobs of sticky\nfluid sprayed down, urged on by the wind to sink\nbeneath the surface like drifting mines.\n\nThen something ominous glinted high above in the\nslowly swaying tips of eternity; he saw it straight away\nof course, but tried to forget it, clenched his fists to\nform a cushion under his neck, and kept his eyes firmly\nshut. But he knew nevertheless, indeed, he could see\nbehind his eyelids that the spider was getting closer and\ncloser, the yellow thread swung gently between the\ndowny stalks of the grass; in a vain attempt to embrace\nthe whole world with its graceful claws, the big, red\nbody expanded and throbbed menacingly, filled with\nanimal desire, animal agony, and a kind of human\ndespair. Jimmie suddenly cried out, but when he\nattempted to leap out of the deep hollow, a shudder\npassed through his body like a swollen vein and he lay\nparalysed as the spider\u2019s body hovered large and lazy,\nindeed, it was the laziness that scared him most, just a\nhand\u2019s breadth above his face. Powerless and at the\nmercy of the insect, his face distorted by his terrified\nmuscles, more helplessly naked than ever before,\ndeprived of any vestige of hard-won dignity, he waited\nfor the spider to fall. The wait seemed endless, and the\nvery delay was the high point of his torture; only a\nmoment more and the disgusting contact would be his\nliberation.\n\nSuddenly a gust of wind dispersed the suffocating\natmosphere, the spider glided over him, lacerating\nJimmie\u2019s left cheek with a hastily lowered claw on its\n\n59\n", "way past, and landed on the left-hand edge of the\nhollow with a soundless thump, throbbing against the\nsilence. Then the spider lay there, crouched diagonally\nabove him, motionless as it lay in wait for some\nmotionless victim, its colour shifting with awe-inspiring\nspeed from grape-green to deep blue and back again;\nshadows dancing in the grass seemed to gasp in horror\nwhen they settled here, and a butterfly which had gone\nastray and wandered into the darkness was pulled down\nirresistibly as if it had wings of iron.\n\nSuddenly, the spider darted out from the edge and\nswung quickly past him, a thread trembled just above\nhis mouth and then, before he knew what was happen-\ning, the red web was secured above his face, and the\nspider lay there, fat and self-assured; it swung lightly to\nand fro so that the whole web dipped down towards\nhim, as if its mere existence were not torture enough.\nOh, if only it would break and embrace him stickily, he\nwould prefer slow suffocation despite everything. But\nthe spider kept on swinging tantalizingly back and\nforth, as if trying to imprint its image upon its prey; he\nhad been blind thus far, it seemed, but now he was\noverwhelmed by certainty; the red peril invaded his\neyes and in the midst of his agony he cried out for help,\npinioned by his fear. His words stretched the mesh in\ndesperation, but eventually they fell back into his\nmouth, as cold and flaccid as coins. He could no longer\ncount on the feelings of fellowship he had so laboriously\ndismantled, but would have to remain in the web for\never, always alone.\n\nThen he felt as if the bottom of the hollow were\ngiving way, he was sinking slowly, the spider shrunk\ninto a tiny grape as the web suddenly came loose and\ndrifted slowly down towards him. Deeper, deeper, he\n\n60\n", "cried out in desperation and fell faster and faster; the\nferocious outline of the web imprinted itself as a\nshadow against the icy grey mouth of his grave, and\nwith a final, pitiful gesture of self-defence, after years\nof agony, he reached its blind bottom.\n\nOnce more he was on his knees outside the stone base\nof the barracks, in one of those years when all was\nindescribable confusion. Hulks of merchant vessels\nfloated in the harbour where they lived, pillaged and\nplundered by the locals; no coachman dared direct his\nhorses into the harbour district any more, horses had\nbeen slaughtered in broad daylight by the starving\nmasses, grass had already overrun the harbour railway\nlines, the harbour rats were thin and easily provoked,\nthe cannonades from the sea grew more intense by the\nday, and on certain mornings he could never forget, the\nlocal children followed their mothers with empty\nbaskets to the barracks at the top of the hill. They lay\nalongside the long, cold, perimeter wall, shivering\nvacantly, without a word, without a smile, without a\nglance at their neighbour, and they had long since given\nup trying to interpret the wild laughter and terrified\nshrieks which engulfed the barracks. \u2018Did they hit you,\nMum?\u2019 he yelled the first time she came out on to the\nsteps, holding on to the wall so as not to fall, and he\nsnatched eagerly at the basket full of whatever the\nsoldiers did not want.\n\n\u2018They didn\u2019t hit, just fondled.\u2019\n\nHis childhood was full of dreary games. Deadly\nserious, they would smash the windows in the cockpit of\nthe crane with pebbles from the forgotten store, and for\nhours on end would crouch - crouching was their\nconstant characteristic \u2014 on the girders of the crane and\npretend they were being besieged by rats; one morning,\n\n61\n", "next to the first of the cranes where his father moored\nthe boat he used for smuggling, they found a tall, oblong\nbundle tied firmly to a pole. They crowded round the\ncanvas parcel like a flock of jackdaws, clambered up the\npole, fiddled with the red string, danced around it like\nRed Indians. The July heat pressed down heavily on all\ntheir heads, and next day they were met by an unknown\nsmell lurking around the bundle; strangely subdued,\nthey sat down on the quay frowning like old men until\nthe harbour patrol arrived in their armoured car, cut\nthe red string, slit open the white sack and flung the\nnaked corpse on to the wharf. Then they all ran off\nhome, shouting, taking pieces of string with them as\nsouvenirs.\n\nThere was a distinct atmosphere of angst in Jimmie\u2019s\nkitchen; his father was lying on the floor pretending to\nbe asleep although he was only drunk, his naked chest\nwas covered in scratches, a newly washed shirt was\nhanging by a piece of string over the stove. A newly\nwashed shirt was hanging by a piece of string over the stove -\nJimmie didn\u2019t need to look more closely at the string\nover the stove and compare it with the piece he had in\nhis pocket; as he ran up the steep hill towards the\nbarracks, everything was excruciatingly clear, every-\nthing was finished and hopeless, his never-ending flight\nhad begun. Huddled under the years of his childhood, he\nallowed everything to flow over him: the brutality of\nthe barracks, the brutal hatred of the starving masses\nwhen the streets had to be cleared, the contempt of\nthose who had eaten to satiety, oh yes, he knew all about\nrunning away from humiliation. The red string always\nwrapped itself round his legs at critical moments, new\nways of running away had always to be found, panic\nsoftened his back and hollowed out his will; success, a\n\n62\n", "career established in doubtful circumstances were the\nnew ways of running away he hit upon, but over and\nover again he was cast back into the mire of memory.\nWhy was everything so cruel, oh, that he would never\nunderstand! How could he understand that when he was\nalways running away?\n\nBut now the bottom on which he lay was rising like\nthe floor of a lift, the red spider was already embracing\nits prey as it swayed in the shadows under the grass. All\nwas lost, all had gone to waste, all the years ignoring\nwhat was right propelled him ruthlessly towards the\nweb. And then those cruel claws, the hairy body\nengulfing him like a wave, and everything dissolving\ninto a blood-red haze. Then just sinking, sinking, and\noblivion.\n", "The Hunger of Day\nHow did day come to the island? Ah, there is plenty to\nsay about that. First of all a bow looked as if it were\nrising from the eastern horizon, horseshoe-like, coated\nwith silver on its outer edge; it pressed up gently against\nthe sun, framing it for a moment like a bucolic\ntriumphal arch, then shot off at reckless speed in well-\npractised loops across the sky, over everyone\u2019s head, as\nfar as the opposite horizon, and then seemed to give way\nto some unknown pressure and fall towards the sea.\nEddies appeared here and there in the morning-blue\nwater, and before it was hit by the broken bow, you\ncould sense a degree of understandable nervousness\nclinging to the surface which until recently had been so\nhysterically tense; suddenly the nerves of the sea were\nexposed so nakedly that an enormous outbreak of\ndespair seemed about to occur at any moment; the\ngigantic fish whose spears used to pierce the bare flesh\nof the blue expanse nevertheless seemed blissfully\nunaware of their role as executioners. Then the crash\ncame; still pliant despite its broken back, the bow sank\ndown into the sea, its long, supple lines outlined for one\nbrief moment on the surface itself before being pulled\n64\n", "rapidly down by an invisible hand, and all at once a\nremarkable colour change took place: the bright silvery\ngleam disappeared without warning, leaving only a\nstinging blueness which spread rapidly under the\nsurface of the sea from the pitiful remains of the bow,\nonly to be hauled up into the day like nets being\nwinched into a boat. The blue of day made its entrance\nand the white morning horses of the clouds galloped\nwearily towards the horizon, in rolled the round sheep,\ngrazing lazily in the very hot sun which was now a\nlonely ball of fire swelling slowly from its own heat.\nA remarkable period of great, confused optimism\nnow followed on the island. Once again, they all\nrealized with a shudder that they were still alive; the\nchill of death which had clung to them throughout the\nnight was thawed yet again as the heat caressed their\nlimbs, gently, gently. If anyone thought he suddenly\nheard birdsong, they would all stand up apprehensively\nwithout a word and stare at each other in bewilder-\nment; it was like diving into unknown waters \u2014 but\nnothing happened as yet. They were just sucked down\ninto the greenery, but nothing happened yet, only those\nfloating corals that were always pushed aside by their\nforeheads. The fire was burning on the beach, the wet\nbranches they broke off and threw down from the cliff\ntop gave off unwavering, tearful smoke which always\nrose vertically and produced little heat; and now there\nwas nothing to roast or boil over it. It just went on\nburning, like a hope rising to the heavens, unstoppable.\nIn silence, but filled with joy which was perhaps not\nobvious but nevertheless for most of them felt like the\nglow that used to emanate from their nursery window\nthe first Sunday in Advent, they gathered round the\nfire, pushed the dark leaves closer to the flames, poked\n65\n", "at a charred branch and steered their gaze along the\ncolumn of smoke right to the top, where it broadened to\nform a blue plateau. Occasionally they would also\nglance out to sea, surreptitiously or quite openly like the\nEnglish girl: she would shade her eyes with her hand and\nwatch the banks of clouds sailing like convoys across the\nhorizon. She was still calm, unspoilt by all the temp-\ntations which hopelessness entails willy-nilly; but her\ngentleness, in her face, body, movements and thoughts,\nsank slowly down, fell off her like the soft clay clinging\nto a shell, leaving it glistening and hard as enamel.\n\nIt was still not very warm, not as hot as it would\nbecome when the heat flung itself upon them almost\nwith a roar, and they would collapse panting in\nsomebody\u2019s shadow. If one wanted, one could now\nclose one\u2019s eyes and be strolling along the holiday beach\nin the quiet summer bay some years previously. The\nwater slowly fell asleep and, suddenly, the white edging\nof froth bordering the beach started gleaming red as\ntens of thousands of shells were caressed out of the calm.\nThe English girl waded slowly out into the water in her\nbare feet, while the captain sat in the sand rubbing away\nat his only jackboot with a stone; and invariably, never\nvarying her familiar posture \u2014 leaning far forward in\nfront of the fire, a dirty length of cloth wrapped around\nher and her hair hanging loose around her head like that\nof a madwoman, one hand stubbornly shielding her\nforehead, eyes, nose, and her left arm dangling non-\nchalantly as if it were out of joint - Madame. Boy Larus,\nthe airman, was still standing timidly by the fire, just\ngazing down at it, occasionally stamping on the ashes at\nits edge, occasionally glancing sadly at the crouching\nwoman. Lucas Egmont seemed to be still trying to sleep,\nlying on his back with arms outstretched like those of a\n\n66\n", "swimmer floating on a lake; the boxer was completely\nhidden by his canvas sheet and lay there rather more\nmotionless than his paralysis would seem to dictate.\n\nThis was the time when hunger would make its\npresence felt. Not the whimpering kind; hunger would\nslowly take possession of them as silently as a float in the\nmorning pond, nudging all thoughts gently aside, its\nsharp, spool-like form relieving some of them just for a\nmoment from the disgusting green slime, and their\nlonging became solid and indivisible. As if in a painful,\ndream-like trance, for their brief hunger had already\ntired them out, they felt the lure of the hollow beside\nthe crippled boxer, where the remains of their food\nsupplies were buried in a box: ship\u2019s rusks, a few tins of\nsardines, green half-rotten pineapples. They\u2019d do any-\nthing to secure that hollow for themselves, or so they\nthought; but they knew they'd never do it in fact. As\nthey felt themselves fading, their hunger seemed to be a\nkind of promise: I am hungry, therefore I am \u2014 and just\nnow, as the merciful sun caressed them so soothingly,\nthis promise was all they needed.\n\nThe water had risen over the English girl\u2019s ankles,\nbut she kept on wading out to sea as shells floated up and\ngathered round her calves like a ring of coral. She\nlooked down, and found she could still base dreams on\nthis red ring. It was that time in the lounge at\nBeavershill; cousin Charles, the one everyone called\nCaruso because his voice had broken, had also come for\nChristmas. \u2018Ah ma ch\u00e9re,\u2019 he said in affected French, he\nwas only fifteen after all, \u2018comme vous \u00e9tes belle, comme\nvous \u00e9tes belle.\u2019 Blushing, he sank to his knees before\nwhere she was sitting on the carpet in front of the fire, it\nwas that Christmas she'd twisted her ankle when she\nfell off a sledge and she still had difficulty in walking.\n\n67\n", "Quick as a flash, he tied two rattles round her thin\ncalves, and how she shook as he helped her to her feet,\nhow the wainscot seemed to bulge, and how endlessly\nlong and uneven the carpet seemed to be because she\nhad to support herself on him as she walked!\n\nYes, everyone seemed to be dreaming, hoping for a\nhappy end, or just out of despair: there are so many\nreasons for dreaming. \u2014 One of them was not dreaming,\nthough; he\u2019d disappeared an hour earlier. He was still\nroaming through the jungle, indeed, as it was not until\nthese last six months of his life that he\u2019d ever seen so\nmany trees, such high grass, such marvellous plants,\neverything was jungle; every step he took, he bent\ncautiously to avoid being hit in the forehead by the\npinacles of the grass; he was no doubt a little afraid as\nwell. Sometimes he stepped into little holes concealed\nby moss and spiders\u2019 webs, and then he would shake so\nmuch with fear that he even had to laugh himself. If\nonly his mates from the dredger could see him now, the\ngiant, the Giant, the Giant Tim Solider.\n\nNow he was scared by every unknown noise that\npierced the air, his legs were so tired they might give\nway any moment, him, the man who\u2019d never been\nscared of anything. Well, once something awful had\nhappened, a preliminary to what was happening to him\nnow, imprinted on his very being by the claws of the\nravens. The dredger had run aground in the fog, they\nsuddenly found themselves stuck in the sand, five\nhundred yards south of the stone quay of Nosara. It was\nquiet and still and damp and the fog surrounded them\nlike four walls, seagulls rose and fell all around them,\nand the tug was half a cable\u2019s length ahead, its engines\nthudding softly. He was alone, and could hear clattering\nand shouting from the boat, and then all of a sudden\n\n68\n", "something remarkable happened and what happened\nwas so terrible that he had to rub his eyes to see if he was\ndreaming - but it was true even so. Wide open\nmouthed, he watched his own eyes come floating\ntowards him through the fog, inflated like little\nballoons but his even so, the enlargement was incredible\nand horrific: he could see all the terrible details of those\ndrumskin-tight globes; the red lines over the whites\nlooked like whiplash wounds, and what a pitiful little\nmembrane it was holding back his pupils and their green\nglobes from falling out and dropping down into the sea!\nThen the eyes were hoisted up by a sudden gust of wind\nand extinguished by the fog, boats immediately started\nbellowing, near and far, but even so he'd never been as\nisolated as he was on that occasion.\n\nI\u2019m blind, he thought, I\u2019ve gone blind, for now it had\ndawned on him how ghastly his eyes were, it no longer\nseemed possible for him to see. He could never shake off\nthe memory of that stretched membrane, and the\nenormous red edges. You can\u2019t possibly see with eyes\nlike that, he thought, groping for the rail like a blind\nman. At that point the dredger must have refloated\nitself and gradually started moving again; as the cables\ntightened the water started singing, but the fog only got\nthicker, and the hull of a white passenger ship loomed\nup in ghostly slow motion to starboard, only to sink\nback again like a mirage as a seagull\u2019s cry tore open a\nchalk-white rip in the veil. Otherwise there was\nnothing to suggest he wasn\u2019t blind: once you've seen\nyour eyes you don\u2019t dare to see. You close your eyes in\npanic, terrified they'll cease to work just as suddenly as\na clock stops; you can see nothing but your own\ninadequate eyes.\n~ Oh, how did he get over it? It took months of\n\n69\n", "harrowing attempts to forget before he regained\ncontrol, before the machinery was working perfectly\nonce more. And now the same thing was happening all\nover again \u2014 what can you do with a machine that has\nsprouted eyes and is filled with distrust as it watches\nitself functioning? He was ground down by misgivings,\nhe could see the idiotic pointlessness of all his finely\nformed joints, his big muscles, all the bones in his body,\nhis movements - and he stepped to one side with his\ndoubts and his fears and watched himself surreptitiously,\nand look: his body was no longer alive, it only moved\nwith difficulty. He was so scared when he thought of\nthe day when everything would come to a standstill,\nwhen everything would become entangled in one\nmonumental fit of cramp. As always, he relied on his\nstrength, protected himself with his speed, thought that\nthe key was to wake up, feel his muscles longing to be\ntensed, feel normal, healthy hunger, healthy because he\nknew it would soon be satisfied; he could already see\nhimself stretched out at the water\u2019s edge, loosely\nstretched like a broken cable, whimpering faintly from\nthe effects of this fire whose greedy tongue was poking\ninto all the channels of his body. In his delirium he\nwould get it into his head that the sun was a ripe apple,\njust one thrust of his body, a lunge with his teeth, and\nthere it was in his mouth, crunching as he bit into it, the\njuice trickling down his chin like blood, the soft flesh\nbeing forced violently down his throat, the more\nvehemently the better. Or fish would start creeping up\nthe beach, their red eyes blinking, wriggling towards\nhim on their bellies; he only had to open wide and they\nwould creep into his mouth, then just bite, and bite\nagain.\n\nRight from the start, of course, his position was so\n\n70\n", "exposed, so hopelessly confused; unfortunate, but it\ncouldn\u2019t be helped. As he was the only member of the\ncrew to survive, he was their leader, with responsibility\nfor his passengers even after the catastrophe, and hence\nto some extent he ought to impose his will on them; he\nwas also a subordinate, their servant, someone they\ncould still shout at in frustration: carry that box over\nhere, give me your canvas sheet, | want to rest, we're\nhungry, bring in the food.\n\nWhy should I be the one to survive, he often moaned\nto himself during those long nights of hunger when his\nkitchen at home in Dunbari embraced him with its\ngreen walls (oh, the eternal frying pan, always the\nfrying pan on the gas stove complete with lid, white\nsteam spurting out of the cracks, and the smell of that\nsteam, the smell of all the butchers\u2019 shops, all the bars,\npubs, grocery stores, restaurants and galleys he had ever\nbeen in throughout his life; and his wife, his blonde wife\nwith the bun in her hair secured by a rubber band: she\nhad the same smell in her hair, the same smell in her hair\nas she stood with arms painfully outstretched in front of\nthe stove, her pure white arms, stopping him from\neating, always stopping him from eating, shouting, My\nchild, my child!). Why was I the one who survived, he\nthought, why not the captain, for instance?\n\nBut the truth was, the captain had been drunk when\nthe catastrophe happened. He often used to sense omens\nthree days in advance, and asked to be locked in his\ncabin with the whole supply of whisky; the first mate\nhad kept him company that last day, and Tim was the\none who swung the wheel round after the fatal change\nof course; just when everything happened, Tim saw him\nhurled to the deck by a huge wave and then, painfully\nand almost disgustingly slowly, float a little way aft\n\n71\n", "before changing direction and being washed just as\nslowly out through the smashed rail, disappearing for\never without the slightest sign of resistance nor even a\nword of farewell. Not a sound came from the crew in\nthe engine room, not the slightest whisper; they'd just\nstayed put, anonymous as always; and then there were\nsome people the lifeboat had fallen on to, it seemed that\nsomebody heavy had suddenly hung on to its side, and it\noverturned in a flash and sank beneath the waves with\nawesome speed. All those who had sought refuge in it\nwere lost without trace.\n\nBut Tim Solider had escaped, more or less miracu-\nlously. He'd been flung overboard like the mate, but\nthey weren't all that far from land in fact; he felt full of\nwater and seemed to be sinking, getting as heavy as lead\nwith the whole of the ocean pressing down on his chest\nlike a stone cross. But to his amazement, his back had\nsuddenly scraped against sharp rocks, he lay there, still,\napathetic, limp, and a grey-green membrane of bound-\nless majesty spread itself over his whole world; as if\ntrapped in a soap bubble, he could see the blurred\noutline of the ship on the other side of the membrane,\nthe shriek staggered through to him and the membrane\nvibrated slightly, then it exploded in a puff of foam and\nhe found himself kneeling in the path of the sea as it\nraced towards him like an express train. Oh, how he\nstruggled that morning to remain alive, he was possessed\nby a raging fury and nothing, be it the slippery stones\nunder everyone\u2019s feet, this cyclone determined to suck\neveryone into the air only to fling them down again on\ntheir backs, or these frenzied people wrestling with him\nin desperation on the reef, for fear of not being rescued\nor fear of being rescued - nothing could stop him.\nTogether with some of the few sensible survivors - the\n\n72\n", "airman, the otherwise unpleasant artillery captain \u2014 he\ncarried ashore first the women, green and shaking and\nmoaning away doggedly as if they were in labour.\nThen, some days after everyone had come to their\nsenses without yet realizing their plight, they estab-\nlished their heroes.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t mention it,\u2019 said the captain modestly to the\nEnglish girl, although he was the one who started it off,\nwith his I know about organization, I\u2019m a soldier you\nsee. These catastrophes will happen, you know, and so I\nnaturally take over, organize things, get a grip on\nthings, if you like. It\u2019s just our duty, you see, duty, my\ndear lady; my young friend the airman and I know best\nwhen it comes to that sort of thing \u2014 isn\u2019t that right?\nTake my boot, will you, and buff it up as well as you\ncan, it\u2019s the twelfth of May today, if I\u2019m not mistaken.\nNo, don\u2019t mention it, my young friend and I are no\nheroes, it\u2019s just that we\u2019ve learnt how to organize\nthings.\n\nWhat about Tim, then? Oh no, nobody said a word\nabout him. He would have liked to shout out in disgust:\norganization! Come off it, panic more like! But some-\nthing held him back. Every time one of the survivors\nturned to him, he felt as if a stream of cold air was\nflowing towards him; it only happened when there was\nsomething that needed doing, something dirty, some-\nthing that had broken, something that hurt, something\ninvolving a risk. You're so big and strong, etc., you've\nbeen coping so well, you\u2019re in better shape than any of\nus, and so on, but their voices were hard and superficial.\nIt was all orders, no requests, no warmth, they just\nwanted him to do as he was told. Even so, at first he was\nproud of the way they appealed to his body; he didn\u2019t\nse\u00e9 through their brutal cunning until his hunger\n\n73\n", "became so strong he realized it would never be satisfied.\nHis body refused to obey him, it became extremely\ndifficult to move a single limb because, all the time, he\ncould see the dead bones moving underneath his skin, his\ncranium was gruesomely bare under skin and sinews, his\nheart compressed and opened with a rhythm that was\nworryingly unsteady.\n\nNow nothing was quite so easy any more, he built up\nhis mental barricades in the hope that he might one day\nbe able to fight on them; he lay there at night, calm on\nthe surface but all the time hunted down ruthlessly by\nhis ego, along the beach, up the cliffs, through the\njungle, and down again along a vertical crevice with\nfew holds for his hands and feet.\n\nWho am I, he would think, who am I? Why should I?\nWhy should I sacrifice myself for all these people, when\nnone of them is prepared to sacrifice himself for me?\nAren\u2019t we all castaways? I was a crewman on the boat,\nthat\u2019s true, but does it matter any more what any of us\nwas? Haven\u2019t we changed our lives fundamentally,\nhasn\u2019t some of what we were been destroyed? Aren\u2019t\nwe all equally naked, aren\u2019t all our fingers equally\ngreedy when the food is shared out, aren\u2019t all our\nfingernails equally sharp when we gather round the\nwater tank? Is there anything here apart from skeletons,\nour skin and our guts to indicate that anybody should\nhave power over anybody else? It may well have been\nthe case on board the boat that somebody could shout to\nsomebody else: listen here, slave, I\u2019m hungry; but surely\nthat right, if indeed it was a right, must have lapsed now\nthat we're all living in the same conditions, where\nmoney, social position and background have been\nstripped away from us all? Haven\u2019t we been resurrected\nfrom the cruel sea, or are the memories of how things\n\n74\n", "used to be going to dictate the way we treat each other\nfor ever? Shouldn\u2019t whoever is strongest, who does\nmost to ensure we can live a bit longer, be the one in\nauthority, the one who gets most credit, the one who\nearns everybody\u2019s respect, the one who glows in the\nwarmth others bestow upon him? And if not? Well, if\nthat isn\u2019t the case, why not stop delivering the goods,\nwhy not just lie down on the sands and listen to the\ncradle-song of the sea, get up when you feel hungry and\ngo hunting on your own account, for it isn\u2019t necessary,\nnor even possible, to take responsibility for people who\nhave nothing but contempt for your services and\nyourself.\n\nBut a new day dawned, and when everybody had\nwoken up and gone for their usual walk round the white\nrock and come back again, he could feel the instinct to\nobey taking possession of him once again, and it was\nterrible. Although nobody said a word to him, although\nnobody shouted at him, they only needed to gesture\ntowards him and he found himself helplessly subordinate\nto these people; jump like a fish, wriggle like a snake -\nno, nothing was any good. It was his fire burning on the\nbeach; the others might well lie watching its cool blue\nflames or throw a twig on when the mood took them,\nbut he was the one who had to keep it going, he was the\none who had to break off spiky branches from the\nbushes although he disliked doing it because they\nseemed to conceal so much that was unknown, he was\nthe one who had to keep a constant check on the height\nof the smoke column over the beach and the intensity of\nthe flames, and he was the one everybody would set\nupon if the fire should go out, complaining, accusing,\npassing judgement, sentencing and banishing.\n\nOh, what was it that held him captive? Was there\n\n75\n", "some special quality present in the others which made\nthem so superior to him? He observed them all in turn,\nweighed their every word, analysed their every move-\nment, scrutinized their every action, and eventually\nconcluded that even the softest of them, the gentlest,\nthe most sensitive of them treated him with a kind of\nself-evident brutality nobody but he seemed to notice,\nprecisely because it was primarily directed at him. The\nEnglish girl would wade out into the water, in exactly\nthe same way day after day; her brown calves were\nattractively taut, just for one rare moment the cloth she\nhad wrapped round her would glide down from her\nright shoulder, which glowed a dark white colour,\nstimulating but chastely repulsing his gaze; the beauti-\nfully tense curve of her neck would resist all efforts to\nbend it down, and no, there was no trace of subser-\nvience, everything seemed to belong to her with a kind\nof mystical naturalness, although she herself didn\u2019t raise\na finger to acquire it. The women he\u2019d known before he\nwas sentenced to death here on the island were\ndifferent, and didn\u2019t even dare to own what they'd\nacquired. Everything had to be asked about over and\nover again: are we allowed to sit here on the grass, just\nthink if somebody comes, are we allowed on this road,\nisn\u2019t it private, am I allowed to like you, don\u2019t you\nbelong to somebody else? He\u2019d never owned himself\neither, and he was just like the women he\u2019d had. Always\nbeing aware; nothing is mine, least of all my body; all\nthose movements I make under the tap when I get home\nfrom the smithy, they\u2019re just on loan; all those thoughts\nbuzzing around in my head are just tourists stopping\nthere for the night, homeless pairs who have rented\nsomewhere where they can make love; the noise from\nthe dredger\u2019s crane will always be heard, the moments\n76\n", "of sweet unrest in my heart are stolen from the shipping\ncompany that employs me.\n\nWhat cure is there, what should a desperate man do\nwhen he becomes aware of his own impotence? One day\nhe\u2019s a little drunk and merry and has a bit more money\nthan usual, takes his old lady to a little pub away from\ntheir usual blue-grey haunts, an upper-class pub. Let\u2019s\nhave a bit of fun shall we, and let the dredger go to hell,\nand that stink of sewers and rotten fish we have to put\nup with every day, poisoning the atmosphere in our\ngloomy flat. Now they can forget all that, the wine is\nsparkling just like it does in the adverts, laughter is\nbubbling away, everything round about them will smell\nnice for once, of wine and flowers, clean glasses, big\nsoft carpets and the musicians all dressed in white \u2014 but\nwhy does everybody stare at them when they come in, it\ncuts him to the bone, pierces right through the effects of\nthe drink he\u2019s already had, and his wife Sally by his side,\nwhy is she whispering: oh, it\u2019s so posh, do we dare go in?\nBut why does everybody stare at you when you're\ncarving the joint so that you get all nervous and your\nknife slips, why does everybody hold their breath and\nlisten in such a provocative way when you laugh, why\ndoes Sally go on all evening about the price of the food,\nthe quality of the tablecloth, the age of the musicians,\ninstead of turning her back on all that, like some people\ncan? No, they all stare at you all the time: do you still\nsmell of sewers even though you have clean clothes on\nand have had several baths during the course of the\nafternoon? Yes, that\u2019s it exactly, you always smell of\nsewers, there\u2019s an invisible cloud around you giving off\na smell which always prevents you from assuming the\nhandsome mien of supremacy which certain other\npeople can, you can never move about in complete\n\n77\n", "freedom, you always have to ask yourself: am I allowed\nto do this, who\u2019s in charge of this, how much does all\nthis cost, will it break if I touch it? How do you think\nanyone can escape from it all? You are sitting there as\nsecurely as anybody can, but secure in your own filth,\nsecure in your own poverty, secure in your own\nimpotence.\n\nIf anybody comes along and says it will all get better,\nor some of it at least, if you don\u2019t believe him, send the\nidiot packing. Should you make a scene? What should\nyou make a scene about \u2014 about those people who stare\nat you when you enter forbidden territory wanting a\ngood time? Oh, yes. But what is it you\u2019re risking, and\nthat little hideaway you've got on the dredger, well, if\nthey find that - what have you gained? No, you're on\nyour own, people are on their own, just get used to that\nand show your teeth if anybody approaches. Good God,\nyou carry your slave nature around with you wherever\nyou go, drag him round all the parks and gardens where\nthe police are on patrol: that\u2019s Tim Solider, the taller\nthey are the further they fall.\n\nWhy not run away then? Yes, you could go out ina\nboat even though you've never done it before, and sail\naway from it all, Brisbane and Mogadishu, Muscat,\nTrincomali, Petsamo and Jacksonville, yes, you could\nsail round and round the map for ever and ever and still\nnot get away from what you want to get away from,\nstill be identified as a servant even so, someone anybody\ncan make use of whenever they like. And then one day\nyou come to an unknown country, a little country, well,\nto be really accurate, an island, where they have no\nlaws, no currency restrictions, no armed police, none of\nthe things you\u2019ve always complained about - and even\nso, you kow-tow with the same unwilling willingness,\n\n78\n", "let yourself be subjugated, feel this fatal sensation of\nimpotent inferiority which you first came across that\ntime in the restaurant and then keep coming across\nwherever you go, whatever you do, wherever you try\nto escape.\n\nThe night of the thirteenth of May was probably the\nworst. Everybody seemed to go to bed early, though it\nis not clear if they were already so exhausted or\nwhether it was illusory; in any case, the captain snored\nin self-satisfaction, and in the weak glow from the fire\nyou could see his hands creeping back and forth over the\ncanvas, like a wolf stalking some prey. The airman\u2019s\ndelicate little head seemed to tremble when touched by\nthe shadows, and his breathing was almost inaudible.\nThe fire crackled discreetly, the occasional iguana still\nawake rattled away up in the cliffs, and the two women\nlay closely intertwined, even in their sleep continuing\nto radiate the usual touch-me-not contempt should\nanyone look at them uninvited. The light from the fire\nglowed on red-headed Madame\u2019s forehead, and at\nfrequent intervals, convulsed by some limitless agony,\nshe would repeat a few half-choked words sounding\nlike: glisso-loo-emm-glisso-loo-emm.\n\nThe cold descended, the sea seemed to be turned to\nstone, even the soughing sounded frozen and was left\nhanging from the stiff waves; but Tim Solider didn\u2019t\nfeel cold, he felt no cold because his hunger was a fire\nburning right through him; his hunger was an awl\nsticking into him wherever it could cause pain; his\nhunger was a bird roasting over the fire, being turned\nround and round on a little stick; his hunger was a\nwoman whispering out of the darkness: of course you\ncan eat, but kiss me first; his hunger was amemory from\nthe kitchen back at home where the frying pan was\n", "always on the gas stove; his hunger was another\nmemory, enclosed by a sea-grey membrane, enthusi-\nastically and yet coolly rising and falling like the\nindicator on an unsteady thermometer inside him, the\nmemory of a path along the beach, up the cliffs, through\nthe jungle and back down along a vertical crevice with\nfew holds for his hands and feet.\n\nThat\u2019s where he was heading for now, unsteadily and\nfrequently stumbling, and already the hot day had\narrived. The first mild warmth had pushed its little joke\nas far as it could, and now the real heat zoomed in like a\nrocket and exploded in the sea, where the breakers\nseemed to be writhing in agony, and in one\u2019s own body\nand in everything round about. The iguanas slid off\ntheir rocks, fell four or five feet, landed on their backs\nand lay there motionless, their yellow bellies arched\ntowards the sun. Tim Solider suddenly fell flat on his\nface as if hit in the neck by a rabbit punch, cut his arm on\na sharp grass stalk and lay there panting in the grass,\nsucking voraciously at his wound. Sweat poured off\nhim, only his mouth was dry as a desert; he made a\nheroic effort and rose to his knees, groped for support,\nthen fell down again. Then he crawled slowly through\nthe grass, feeling as if he were being grilled over\nembers; it grew hotter and hotter as time went by. His\nsweat dried up, the whole of his body was now painfully\ndry, all his fluids seemed to have been sucked away and\nevery time he crawled over some unevenness in the\nground, he was convinced he would be reduced to\ncrumbs. Now and then giant lizards rattled past in front\nof him, horrifyingly slowly, and from some angles\nlooked like snakes; something with a cold, rasping belly\ncrawled agonizingly slowly over both his legs, but he\n\n80\n", "didn\u2019t have the strength, nor the courage, to turn round\nand see what it was.\n\nHours passed by, and still he was crawling along with\nexasperated energy; thousands of shooting pains plagued\nhis body, his nerves were exposed to every agony\nhoming in on him, smoke was rising from the ground,\nacrid and bitter, until in the end he could hardly\nbreathe. This plain was endless; even when he raised his\nhead as far as he could manage, he could see no end to it,\nonly this tall, scorched grass with panicles swinging to\nand fro like hanged corpses high above his head. In an\ninfinite vision of terror, he experienced eternity, all\ntime ceased to exist, space ceased to exist, he was no\nlonger a human being, he had no human qualities left,\nwhat did action mean? Colours faded away, sound was\nmuted, thoughts were no longer thought, words lost\ntheir meaning, surfaces lost their edges, everything\nossified, leaving only himself an anonymous being,\ncrawling like a snake indefatigably over this horrific\nexpanse without moving forwards or backwards, since\nall directions and all points of the compass were no\nmore. Immersed in a hazy dream, he remembered his\nhappy childhood when there was a five-minute run\nthrough what was now eternity.\n\nHe lay there for quite a long time with his face\npressed hard into the ground, his hands outstretched,\npalms upwards as if he were expecting it to rain,\nsenseless, apparently lifeless; but all the time something\ninside him was working intensively towards a particular\ngoal, indeed, he was there already even though he\ncouldn't move because of the intense heat and his own\nexhaustion. Gradually, however, the heat of the sun\neased somewhat, he slowly recovered consciousness,\n\n81\n", "and after many pitiful attempts to get to his feet, he\neventually managed it.\n\nStill dizzy and weak after his loss of consciousness, he\nstaggered through the grass once again, not really in a\nposition to see anything at all, but nevertheless aiming\nstubbornly in a particular direction. The ground was no\nlonger smoking now, a very large iguana at least a\ncouple of feet long lay asleep in the grass: he stumbled\nover it and whipped round, ready to defend himself if it\nshould attack. But the iguana had not moved, and\nsomewhat surprised, he bent down over it and poked it\ncautiously with his foot; but still it didn\u2019t stir. Then he\nturned it over quickly, so that it was lying on its back: it\nwas dead, of course, its belly split open by a stone;\nsomebody had crushed the iguana with a stone, and\nturned it upright before running away. Tim lifted the\nheavy corpse and hurled it into the undergrowth.\n\nPerplexed, he looked back in the direction he\u2019d come\nfrom, and saw the white column of smoke rising above\nthe trees, vertical, like a rope hanging down from the\nsky. The sky was unbearably blue and empty, and out of\nthe void, as if emerging from a magician\u2019s hat, a flock of\nbirds appeared, then descended upon him in deathly\nsilence, dragging their wings over the grass, apparently\nwithout seeing him even though the nearest one\nswooped past only a hand\u2019s breath above his head; he\nhad ducked involuntarily, and only now did he realize\nhow unusually large the birds were.\n\nHe continued wandering through the grass, guided\nby his memory, and emerged on toa stony plateau, with\nblack, volcanic rocks splashed with bird droppings.\nCliffs rose steeply on either side of the plateau, naked\nand scarred, but at one point the cliff was pierced, and a\nv-shaped crack big enough to take a human body\n\n82\n", "presented a hazardous route down to the beach. He\npaused and listened to the sea crashing on to the rocks\ndown below: it sounded like a percussionist\u2019s first\ntentative beats on his drum. His heart started pounding\nas he strode towards the crevice, excited without\nknowing why; or rather: without wanting to know\nwhy.\n\nThen he paused again, gripped by a strong feeling of\nbeing watched by someone he couldn\u2019t see as yet. The\npenny dropped immediately, and he stepped back in\nirritation. It was the birds that were observing him as\nthey sat clamped to the cliff, apparently guarding the\nway down to the beach, motionless and silent, without\nso much as a twitching of their wings; he could see now\nthat they weren\u2019t in fact as big as he\u2019d thought when\nthey swooped down a short while ago. They were\ndangerous because of their numbers rather than their\nsize, and their beaks were as sharp as talons; he couldn\u2019t\nmake out their eyes, which seemed to be directed at him\nand yet failed to follow him when he backed off; they\nwere grey as well, as if covered by a film. Without a\nsound, he broke off a blade of grass and moved stealthily\ntowards the crevice, letting the grass blade swing to and\nfro all the way along the row of birds: but their eyes just\nkept on staring vacantly in the same direction.\n\nNo doubt about it: the birds were blind, and that was\nwhy they brushed along the grass before landing. Dumb\nand blind, they led their lives on this island, and one\ncould well ask why. Were they waiting for something?\nWere they intending to take advantage of a certain\nshipwreck? Was their sole purpose to wait for these\nseven people condemned to die? Tim dropped his blade\nof grass, then stood motionless to see if they\u2019d noticed\nanything yet, but everything was as before. Then he\n\n83\n", "tentatively took hold of a rocky pinnacle, crouched\ndown and crawled along through the crevice, emerging\nunharmed on the other side. Stunned by the vastness of\nthe panorama, he almost fell but flung himself back-\nwards against the cliff and hung on as the vista\nimpressed itself upon him. The sea was in a state of\nperpetual motion, surging in over the horizon; the\ntension between sea and sky was almost unbearable,\neverything was clear and large, no dirty smoke rose\nfrom ships to smudge the brilliant colours, not a sliver of\nland was to be seen, the sun was already starting its\ndescent and the heat was growing less intense; a few red\nstars rose slowly up from the depths, everything was so\nclassically beautiful, and yet so completely indifferent.\n\nAll the time his gaze was drawn irresistibly towards\nthe island, towards the thin strip of beach, covered in\nsand and stones at this point. For the second time in his\nlife on the island, he saw the green box lying down\nbelow like a little die wedged between two large stones,\ndangerously tempting, aiming an invisible beam of heat\nstraight up at the cliff. Hot and eager, he decided on the\nspot to begin the risky descent. He forgot the birds and\nall the rest of it, his hunger clamped him firmly to the\ncliff face, his hunger selected the best footholds and the\nbest projections for his hands. But when he was about\nhalfway down and still had not got round to thinking\nabout being afraid, a little stone right next to the one\nsupporting his right foot suddenly came loose and\ntumbled down the cliff in a series of sharp thuds. His\nfoot began to twitch in ridiculous fashion, and he had to\ntake a firm grip on himself and calm down again; then\nhe heard a fluttering sound above his head, and when he\nbent his head back to see what was happening, he saw\none of the birds on its way down towards him, hopping\n\n84\n", "from ledge to ledge, its eyes staring indifferently out\ninto space; but its feet were as sensitive as a blind man\u2019s\nfingers and unerring in their choice of secure grips.\n\nAt first, he didn\u2019t realize what might happen, but\nwhen he eventually caught on, he forced himself back,\ntrembling, against the cliff face, rubbed his body against\nit as if that would help him to achieve a firmer hold. It\nonly needed the bird to touch one of his hands, brush\nagainst his shoulder, bump into his foot - and he would\nhurtle down to his death, would die with the green box\nonly a couple of miserable yards away from him, would\ndie just when salvation was so desperately near. But the\nbird came closer and closer, worst of all was the assured\nway in which it was progressing, oh, if only it had\nscreeched, had flapped its wings madly, tried to peck\nhim with its beak; but no: only this silence waiting to be\nshattered by violent action, whose terrible nature he\ncouldn\u2019t yet conceive.\n\nThen it made one final lunge towards him, down\ntowards his right hand, and in desperation he let go,\ngroping in thin air, rasping his nails against the cliff, and\nfor one agonizing second he could feel himself slipping,\nthe whole cliff seemed to collapse and spin round with\nhim, blood seeped out from under his shredded finger-\nnails, then everything calmed down again gradually and\nhe regained his grip with his right hand, hugging the\ncliff as tightly as he could.\n\nThe bird was now still again just a couple of feet\nabove his head, waiting motionlessly, ruthlessly calm\nand staring vacantly at the horizon; its red-tipped beak\nwas pointing downwards all the time as if it could see, as\nif it took pleasure in observing his fear. Was the bird\nalready suspicious, did it know he was there, was he\nm\u00e9rely being given the moment of grace by his\n\n85\n", "executioner? Oh, he didn\u2019t dare breathe although his\nchest was fit to burst from the terrible pressure; he\nslowly let go again with his right hand, stood up on his\ntoes, grasped a spike of rock with his left hand so tightly\nthat he was in pain, and stretched his right hand out\ntowards the bird, fingers outstretched; he grabbed it by\nthe neck, and then like lightning, with a jerk more\nviolent than he thought himself capable of, he hurled its\nheavy body into space. He could hear the swishing noise\nas it fell, and heard it flop into the water. Sweat was\npouring off him, he was shaking in every sinew and he\nsuddenly forgot where he was, was about to take a step\nbackwards, and had already raised one foot in the air\nbefore he came back to his senses. With eyes closed, he\nclambered slowly down the cliff face like a big, grey\ncaterpillar, and it was only when he reached the safety\nof the last few feet and he saw the green box lying\nbetween the stones like a green die that he once again\nbecame aware of his hunger.\n\nAs frenzied as a hound following a scent, he let go\nmuch too soon and crashed down on to the sands, the sea\nfilled his ears with a deafening roar and its spray\nsplattered all over the sand and the pebbles, a rainbow\nquivered back and forth before his startled eyes and the\nsmooth, empty, half-buried iguana skins glistened in the\nwavy sands. His body came alive again, it was like\nwaking up from a dream of a dream, he was no longer\nwatching himself, his movements were no longer\nskeleton-like; even his hunger was transformed into\ndelicious pain, but it didn\u2019t hurt, merely warmed him.\nOh, how he wanted to wallow in his salvation, enjoy it,\ntaste it, lick it with his voluptuous tongue.\n\nAgonizingly slowly, he crawled over the sand to the\nbox; with eyes closed, he extracted every ounce of\n\n86\n", "pleasure from the rare perfumes flowing into him,\nopened his mouth and tasted pineapples melting on his\ntongue, bread from Myra and Lendarsis, long white\nloaves with green seeds and an aroma of cherry\nblossom, the smell of winter apples stored in the attic in\nold houses in the country, the spiced scent of meat and\nsawdust that filled the quayside warehouses also\nemanated from the box, this box was indeed infinite in\nwhat it had to offer, bottomless, it had everything: the\nfresh bread his brother the baker sometimes used to\nbake on winter mornings and sent home with little\nChristine, the smells from the frying pan at home and\nthe big bag of sweets his mother always kept in a\ncupboard as a bribe to make him tell lies when his father\nused to ask if anything had been happening at home that\nweek when he was working nights. In the end he\nembraced the box as if it had been a woman, pressed his\near against it and heard all the dishes in the world\nboiling, frying, bubbling away on the stove, being\npoured out, being carved up, sliced, ground, clinking of\nknives and forks, quick gulps and little belches, chairs\nbeing pushed back from the table and the muffled\nsizzling of soups in soup kitchens, the turgid slurping of\ngreasy soups, a magnificent rumble as gigantic cauldrons\nwere emptied, then nothing but the roar of the ocean\ncascading over him with its vast choir of voices, and\nthen those voices, one of which, rancorous and obsti-\nnate, took possession of him, accused him with acid\nurgency, forcing him on the defensive.\n\nStupefied, but still inspired by all that had happened\nto him, he just lay there, clutching the box tightly to\nhim and watching the dead bird bobbing up and down\nover towards the headland. If he turned over, he could\nsee the big, silent flock of birds clinging high up on the\n\n87\n", "cliffs, motionless, and the smoke from the little camp on\nthe other side of the island, spiralling devoutly heaven-\nwards; he was disturbed to note how it gradually\nchanged direction and started wafting right across the\nisland in a gigantic arc, straight towards him; was that\nsomeone running up there in the dry grass, maybe\nwhoever it was who had killed the iguana, or perbaps it\nwas just some animal trying to scare him? Was someone\nstanding up there now in that narrow exit, guarded by\nthe birds, staring at him frenziedly? It would be very\neasy to loosen a little stone and throw it down at him.\nScared in advance, uncertain in advance, already\nrocked back on his pedestal, he huddled in the tiny\nshadow of the box: such a big man and such a little\nshadow. The dialogue between Tim and the sea, so long\nprepared for, could begin at last:\n\n\u201cSo, you've found something good, have you?\u2019\n\n\u201cYes, I saw this box the very first day. It was in\nexactly the same place as it is now, only a bit closer to\nthe sea. I noticed a fish jumping out of the water just\nbehind it.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t climb down and fetch it then, did\nyou?\u2019\n\n\u201cNo, I wasn\u2019t hungry then, I thought like everybody\nelse that our rescuers were just round the corner. We'd\ngot plenty of meat come to that, and pineapples, and\nbiscuits, and somebody thought they\u2019d seen hares in the\nundergrowth near the camp. Somebody suggested we\ncould go fishing and get by in that way.\u2019\n\n\u2018You didn\u2019t tell anybody you'd seen a box of\nprovisions on the beach, did you?\u2019\n\n\u201cNo. Nobody was hungry, but even so the mood was\nedgy and I thought my discovery would only make\neverything even worse. They might start arguing about\n\n88\n", "how to divide the spoils, for instance, especially as\nsomebody had already suggested the women and the\ninjured man should be on reduced rations.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ah, so you kept it quiet out of consideration for the\nothers, not for yourself. It didn\u2019t occur to you that you'd\npretty soon start running short of food, especially when\nthe meat started stinking and had to be buried. You\nweren't thinking of keeping the box for your own use\nlater on? You weren\u2019t reckoning quite ruthlessly on\ngetting to the point where your own hunger would\ncrave everything you could lay your hands on?\u2019\n\n\u201cNo, a hungry man doesn\u2019t rationalize things, a\nhungry man is passionate and ruthless, a hungry man has\nto do anything he can in order to satisfy his hunger, and\neverything else goes by the board. Being considerate is\njust something you do when you\u2019re mixing with people\nwho aren\u2019t hungry.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut you weren't hungry when you first saw the box.\nAnd you weren't all that hungry when you started\nspreading the rumour about hares being seen in the\nundergrowth \u2014 it was you who started that one - and\nyou weren\u2019t hungry even when you started suggesting\nto the others that they could catch fish, although you\nknew full well it wasn\u2019t possible. Why did you spread\nrumours you knew full well weren\u2019t true? Was it to\ndistract them from the possibility of maybe finding\nthings washed up on the beach? Or were you just being\nnice and preventing them from getting over-excited?\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat consideration do I owe to these people who\ncall themselves my comrades? I\u2019ve saved several of\nthem - isn\u2019t that enough? What consideration have they\nshown me, what comradeship, what warmth, what\nrespect, what faith? All the time they\u2019ve made it clear\nthat I\u2019m the servant and they\u2019re the masters, and what\n\n89\n", "does a slave owe his master apart from actually serving\nhim?\u2019\n\n\u201cYet again a pitiful failure to face the truth. What is\ncomradeship but living together in the same circum-\nstances? If the provision merchant loses all he owns and\ncomes to beg a share of your wretched lot, do you send\nhim packing like a stranger, or do you try and win him\nround instead, because you know you two have the most\nfundamental things in common: hunger which must be\nsatisfied, and the affront of need which must be washed\naway?\u2019\n\n\u2018Didn\u2019t I do everything I could to win them round? I\ndid everything they asked me to do, opened those boxes,\nfed the injured, kept that fire going, went without\nsleep, all for their sake.\u2019\n\n\u2018Since when has it been so praiseworthy to have a\nslave mentality? You didn\u2019t need to obey once all the\nsymbols of power had been shipwrecked, but you kept\non doing so all the same. What kind of mysterious\nquality made you click your heels and bow your head as\nsoon as these people, who are just as ragged and naked as\nyou are, gave you an order? You were too cowardly to\nsee whether you could act in the same way yourself,\nwhether you could say to the captain: fetch me a\nbranch, I want to warm myself by the fire. No, you\nfound another way round it all; while you were still\nwell-fed you reckoned in cold blood that a time would\ncome eventually when your hunger would be greater\nthan anybody else\u2019s. Then you thought: soon I'll be\nhungry, I'll be wild and ruthless, that\u2019s when I'll rebel\nagainst these terrorists, not openly, but in a roundabout\nway. You sat there coolly and worked out how you\ncould take advantage of your state of intoxication, that\nwas what was so contemptible. Just how much is a\n\n90\n", "man\u2019s lust for rebellion worth if it stays in hiding when\nhe has plenty to eat? Now you're lying here beside your\nbox, your big secret, and you think you\u2019re rebelling; but\nall you\u2019re managing to do is to run away from your\nrebellion, you\u2019re hiding away like a coward behind the\nmost noble of pretexts.\n\n\u2018Ah well, it wasn\u2019t the first time; it\u2019s something\nyou're used to, my friend. Fair enough, William was\nbleeding something awful when the police had finished\nwith him on the strike-breaker boat\u2019s foredeck, once it\nhad become known he was the one trying to organize\nthe underground campaign on behalf of the strikers.\nFair enough, it\u2019s quite understandable: you had no\ndesire to bleed like that. Your liver, kidneys, spleen,\nlungs - they\u2019re all pretty sensitive organs, and if you get\nthoroughly beaten up like that any one of then could\neasily burst. And what\u2019s more, it\u2019s understandable that\nyou wanted to avoid other kinds of unpleasantness, we\nall know how vulnerable some people\u2019s nerves and some\npeople\u2019s marriages are. Most of all: you were afraid all\nkinds of injustice would become unavoidable if you\nfaced the consequences of organizing the disturbances.\nNo doubt there are problem children and orphans even\namong the ones who were regarded as oppressors. On\nthose grounds alone there was no obvious duty to rebel\nlike you\u2019d heard somebody going on about, despite the\nfact that the old lady who'd been sleeping in the stair-\nway the last four nights died coughing and obviously in\ngreat pain in a loony-bin bed a week or two later.\n\n\u201cCome on now, there were probably all kinds of\nthings you could have done but didn\u2019t, and now it\u2019s\ntoo late. You can\u2019t stir up trouble when you're in\namong comrades, that\u2019s not rebellion any longer, it\u2019s\ntreachery.\u2019\n\n91\n", "\u201cThen all I ask is: let me live a little bit longer. I can\ndrop all my excuses, I can drop all my masks; look, I\u2019m\nstanding here naked, indecently naked before myself,\nand I\u2019m begging myself: let me live a little bit longer. I\ndo so want to breathe, I do so want to smell the sea as it\nbreaks again and again over the reef till it goes down on\nits knees and begs for mercy, and I\u2019m so scared my body\nwill start observing itself again, that my eye will stare at\nmy naked eye and hence won't be able to see a thing. I\nwant to live a little bit longer, no matter how wretched\na state I\u2019m in.\u2019\n\n\u201cThen all you have to do is attack that box, split it\nopen, laths and all, grab all the contents and gobble up\nthe whole lot, lie there for days on end, and lick the\nwood clean when there\u2019s nothing else left. Then just\nfeel how much alive you are, how easily your legs carry\nyou up the steep slopes and over to the camp, and how\neagerly your nose registers the smell of an abandoned\ncamp, burnt-out fire, and dead bodies; how keen your\nhands will be when you seek out a suitably big branch\nthat'll serve as a spade, and fill the whole of that\nbeautiful beach with seven graves. Don\u2019t forget your-\nself, you'll have gained yourself a week or so, and\nduring that time you can stroll around the island like\none of those iguanas. Maybe you'll get a hard shell in the\nend, just like them. Learn their habits, take up their way\nof life, and then you won't have to die for another three\nhundred years yet! You'll avoid all those relationships in\ntime and space with other people, all those obligations,\nall those invisible contacts and mutual dependencies\nwhich make human life worth living. But before you\nturn into an iguana, before you go numb, before you\nlose the ability to speak, cry out into the silence: my last\naction as a human being was treachery.\u2019\n\n92\n", "Seven seas erupted over him, one after another they\npoured in over the horizon, no, they came from the box,\nthe boundless box; the swell rose and fell, then suddenly\nit was only falling. Now cauldrons were being emptied\nin a million kitchens, water was running over all the\nfloorboards, rippling over polished pine, seeping\nthrough cracks and swishing in stringy strands out of his\ndream. Suddenly the box fell silent, something in it died\nonce and for all, and wakened by this silence, scared by\nit, Tim sat up quickly. The sight that confronted him\nwas fantastic, and he grew first stiff, then limp with\nterror. The high, black cliff he had clambered down\nnow seemed much higher, its black streaks projected\nspitefully and brutally like swollen veins; the sun was\nsinking rapidly into the sea and seemed not to be able to\nfind a foothold on the cliff, but it glistened on the red\nbeaks of the birds as they trooped down the cliff face,\nspread out in a vast formation, hopping slowly from\nledge to ledge, with just a wing\u2019s breadth between\nthem. That was a net he could never penetrate.\n\nIf I run, he thought, it\u2019s because I\u2019m running away\nfrom the birds. If I take the box with me, it\u2019s so that the\nblind birds can\u2019t plunder it. Oh, how he ran over the\nuneven beach, stumbling over stones, splashing into\ntreacherous pools, clawing his way up rocks, sliding\ndown the other side, wading across little inlets where\nslender rays lived their hermit-lives, half-swimming in\ndeep water around cliffs where there was no beach, all\nthe time clinging on to that heavy box, carrying it on his\nhead, on one shoulder or the other, clutched to his thigh\nor hanging down his back. Once he saw the bird he had\nkilled: it had floated round a headland and was now just\nlying there ina pool of still water. At last, the ship came\ninto view on its reef, the sun was playing gently on its\n\n93\n", "skeleton, the fire was burning on the beach, and\nsomeone was walking up and down, wringing his hands.\n\nHe yelled out in a whisper: here I am, I\u2019ve got food\nfor you, you bastards; and he fell in a heap, gasping.\nThey turned the box the right way up, saw it was\nmarked C.O. (Captain\u2019s Office), and ripped open the\nlid. Madame, for once enticed out of her agony,\nsuddenly burst into laughter, squirting it out like a\nwhale, as she groped around with her savage fingers\namong the multicoloured glass beads the box was full\nof, the pearls for which the Eslamite natives sold their\nhides and themselves to anyone with enough boats,\ncharts and stars to find their way there.\n\n94\n", "The Sorrow of Sunset\n\nIt was at sunset one day when Madame killed an iguana.\nShe had a stone in one hand, and when she heard the\nrustling in the grass, she stopped and waited, without a\nsound. When the animal emerged out of the gloom, she\nwas frightened at first by its size: she hadn\u2019t intended to\nkill such a big iguana, but with the aid of the stone she\nsoon had it over on its back before it could bite her or\nrun away. Once she\u2019d killed the iguana with the stone,\nshe turned it over on to its belly again, so that it would\nlook as if it were still alive, sleeping in the grass, or on\nits way somewhere extremely slowly. She threw the\nsticky stone a long way away, and heard it crash into\nanother one on the beach.\n\nOn her way back, she nearly fell over a big iguana\nsleeping in the grass, whipped it over on its back\nwith her bare hands, and discovered it was dead.\nOn her way back to camp, she\u2019d been going round\nin circles and returned to the exact spot where she'd\nkilled the iguana. The third time it happened, she\ndecided to scream. She gave a short, piercing scream\nand, immediately, someone came rushing through\nthe grass; she could tell from the crackling of the canvas\n\n95\n", "and the squeaking of the jackboot that it was the\ncaptain.\n\nShe stood in front of the iguana so that he couldn\u2019t see\nit, wrapped her cloth sheet tightly around her as if she\nwere cold, and when he arrived, said to him in a\nplaintive voice: \u2018Captain, help me down again, please. I\nsuddenly feel unwell.\u2019\n\nWithout saying a word, they crossed over the grassy\nplateau, where the horizontal light of the setting sun\nwas lighting up the grass panicles from underneath, so\nthat they looked like lips, blood-red lips pursing to meet\nother lips. They emerged on to the cliff top, and\nMadame paused to enjoy the view down the path, over\nthe beach, the ship, the sea, the horizon, which now\nseemed to be bulging under the weight of the sun. The\nrocks below them were gleaming red with a modest\nbrick-like colour very familiar to her; large expanses of\nsea as still as water in a glass had assumed the same\nsoothing hue, and the wavy columns of smoke coming\nfrom the fire on the beach also looked red. As usual, the\nthin English girl was at the boxer\u2019s side, more interested\nin herself than in him. The captain\u2019s arm was resting\ngently on Madame\u2019s shoulder; she could feel its\nwretched inertness through the cloth, and put off by this\nsensation of coldness, she started on her way down in\norder to be alone at last.\n\nThe small iguanas were scuttling around agilely at\nher feet, but she no longer had any feelings when it\ncame to iguanas. Ignoring everybody\u2019s gaze, she made\nher way to her place by the fire, which was marked out\nby four thin lines she drew in the sand with her\nforefinger every morning in order to be alone. In order\nto be even more alone, she curled herself into a ball so\nthat her face was hidden by her hands and her hands by\n\n96\n", "her knees and her knees by the cloth. Thus ensured of\nher privacy, she felt as if she were sinking down from\nthe world as if in a lift, confused and cluttered up with\ninessentials, sinking down into a necessary sorrow.\n\nThe sorrow took possession of her, cleansing, vehe-\nment, untarnished now that the iguana had been killed,\nand precise and cruel in such a natural way that there\nwas no room for any other thoughts. Pure sorrow is\nmajestic in its ferocity, and for these brief moments in\nthe sunset, she experienced all its necessary stages: the\nbrief, stupefying paralysis when you think you've\ngasped the truth, although you know next to nothing\nabout the truth as yet; something protests inside you and\nyour heart suddenly feels staggeringly strong, as if it\nwere beating outside your body somehow or other.\nThen the first tears come to your eyes, even though\nyou're not actually crying and don\u2019t even want to cry.\nThey are unusually big and hot as tears go, and if you\ntried tasting them, they'd probably be much saltier than\nyour usual cut-price tears. You dry these tears, and all is\nwell again for the moment; but well in a kind of tense,\nglass-like way. It\u2019s as if you might put your foot through\nit at any moment, and fall at breakneck speed.\n\nBut you haven't started falling yet, and the glass gets\nthicker and thicker, as if you were drifting further and\nfurther away from your sorrow, and you feel furious\nbut helpless as the distance between you and your\nsorrow grows, a dull despair fills you in large, thick\nlumps. But then you find something in time or space\nwhich helps to bring you down again, an open door\nthrough which you can fall, and on a purely physical\nlevel it comes as a relief after all the hard tension you've\nbeen through. Something gives way inside you, tears\ncome to your eyes and lie there like radiators until they\n\n97\n", "dissolve. Then one thing leads to another in an unending\nchain, and soon there\u2019s nothing more you can see, hear\nor feel which isn\u2019t directly connected with the object of\nyour sorrow, and every time something new emerges,\nthere\u2019s an explosion inside you, violent at first, giving\nrise to tears and a strange soporific pain which starts in\nyour diaphragm and then moves upwards, the explosions\ngrow weaker, but there is no pause. Now you're\nsobbing quietly and constantly and copiously, you gave\nup drying your tears ages ago, but your sobbing gives\nyou a strangely fresh and pure feeling in your nose, as if\nyou'd been sucking certain throat tablets.\n\nTime passes, and gradually, everything closes around\nyour sorrow like a flower closing for the night; it\u2019s not\nlike being encased in armour, just a cool, flower-like\nenvelope through which you can hear it pulsating,\nyou\u2019re still partaking of it, it\u2019s alive and well inside you\nand you can moisten your lips with it whenever you\nwish, like sipping from a fresh, clear stream; but even\nnow you can choose yourself, to some extent, exactly\nwhen you want to associate with it. The danger,\nhowever, is that you leave it in peace for too long: fresh\nsorrow has to be tended assiduously, taken out occasion-\nally like the dearest of treasures and polished like a\nmirror, or else it will all too soon acquire that hard\nshell, and the armour plating becomes a fact, something\nwhich cannot be prevented in the long run, of course.\n\nAnd once the armour plating is there, you\u2019re in a way\nback where you started from, once again there\u2019s this\ndistance in time and space, but now it feels more\nhopeless than it used to do because you know there\u2019s\nnothing to expect. Instead of the dull, insistent despair\nwhich filled every cavity within you the first time, a\nhorrible period of apathy now takes over, of restless\n\n98\n", "waiting, waiting for nothing to happen. Nothing\nmatters any more, everything round about you takes on\na hardness, you want to take hold of something, but all\nyou can grasp is dead, you want to look but your gaze is\nrejected by the hardness of the object, you want to make\nlove but you realize you can\u2019t, for you yourself are also\nencased in the same hard film, all your feelings seem to\nhave frozen stiff, you\u2019re dried up and shrivelled, and not\neven your own unbearable loneliness can make you\ntremble.\n\nOf course, not even this lasts for ever, at first you\nnotice little currents working away industriously under\nthe armour and under the ice, and one day it all breaks\napart and for one last time you are reunited with your\nsorrow. But you don\u2019t feel numb this time, your body\ndoesn\u2019t partake as heavy-handedly as it did before, it\u2019s\nas if your muscles, your blood vessels and your joints\nwhich used to become tense with sorrow can no longer\nmanage it. Everything shifts now to the level of\nmemory, you keep returning over and over again to the\nsite of the fire, search through the devastated ruins and\nfind twisted bits of a life lying coiled up like snakes\nunder soot and girders. Now your memory drags these\nremnants like a crowbar, a useful yoke or a copper\nbucket out into the street, into its merciless cold light,\nand identifies them slowly and ina state of quiet agony,\nalso called melancholy, under a street lamp. On the\nanvil of memory, with the aid of memory\u2019s hammer and\ntongs, you beat these bits and pieces until they're\nstraight, then meticulously reconstruct their position in\ntime and space and emotions, and this ruin is inex-\nhaustible, this site devastated by fire conceals under the\nashes things you\u2019d thought lost long ago, hands not yet\nquite dead reach out towards you from the bonfires, and\n\n99\n", "everywhere are those foreheads whose white domes can\nnever be completely covered by charcoal and ashes.\n\nThese periods of sorrow usually take months, even\nyears to pass through, but Madame endures all of them\nduring the brief sunset, the shock, the first painful\nsurprise, the fateful tension, the fall, the dissolution and\nthe temporary hardening, and then this chase through\nmemory which, to the accompaniment of horses\u2019\nhooves, led her into the deepest recesses of solitude.\n\nNow the sun was sinking so very, painfully slowly, as\nif for the last time; a red spring seemed to gush forth\nfrom under the sea, and the gigantic grey clouds,\nspurting upwards as if from a kettle behind a spiky\nheadland crowned by gigantic fingers, climbed verti-\ncally upwards like factory chimneys, gradually turning\nbrick-red, into a sky where pink shadows were still\ndarting around, uncertain of what to do next. And all\nthose birds, creeping out of the ship\u2019s innards one by\none, and waddling over the sloping deck before taking\noff. They were flying unusually high, and for a while\ncircled around the column of smoke rising tirelessly\nfrom the beach. Everything was so silent, the rattling of\nthe iguanas had ceased, and the breezes were no longer\npenetrating Tim Solider\u2019s jungle. There was a moment\nwhen life seemed to shrink, and the pulse of time,\nalready beating weakly enough in this island environ-\nment, seemed to have stopped altogether; now anything\ncould happen, everything could be compressed and\ndrawn-out events foreshortened as in a drama, and\neverything could be experienced in the time it took to\ndraw breath.\n\nMadame had had a lot of men, but none of them was\nquite like him. Several of them had racing cars and\ndrove them slowly along the boulevards: she still hadn\u2019t\n\n100\n", "seen any of them driving fast, and soon saw through\ntheir petty wiles. They loved to give the impression of\nsomething they called \u2018latent power\u2019. Just as the long,\nthrobbing bonnets of their cars were supposed to\nsuggest speeds of a hundred miles an hour, they wanted\nwomen to caress their leather jackets and feel them\nbristling with enormous power which they were only\nable to hold back with the greatest difficulty. They\nwore long leather gloves with thick fingers, and would\ngesture eagerly at the steering wheel during intimate\nconversations, as if involved in a continual boxing\nmatch. But bereft of their gloves and leather jackets and\nriding breeches with green bindings, they were insecure\nand hesitant, almost shy in fact. How touching it was to\nkeep hearing them whisper when they'd stopped the car\namong the willows in some luxuriant park, and\nembraced you, roughly and brutally, with hands that\nhad only too reluctantly let go of the steering wheel and\ngear lever, preoccupied despite their apparent frenzy,\nand with bodies which, even when they seemed\nbrimming over with latent power and at the most\ntender of moments, longed to feel the throbbing of the\nengine: I expect I\u2019m your first, aren\u2019t I; or when they\ndiscover you're already married: I expect I\u2019m the first\nman you've been unfaithful with.\n\nOh yes, she thought she knew these vain, ridiculous\npeople who claimed to despise passion and affection,\nbecause they themselves were too cowardly to dare to\nfeel anything but frigidity. Even so, they could be\npassionate enough when they thought no one was\nlooking, and the warmth they were too cowardly to\nshow their women they squandered on the gleaming\ncylinders of their racing cars. You sometimes caught\nthem alone in their cars with an expression in their eyes\n\n101\n", "and around their lips which would have been natural\nand desirable when they were together with a woman,\nbut was perverse precisely because they were alone.\nThen they would sit up with a start, they would be\nterrified and look as guilty as if you\u2019d caught them ina\ncompromising situation with their friend\u2019s wife.\n\nOh yes, she knew all of them. The makes of their cars\nvaried, as did the colour of their jackets and the way\nthey sipped their cognac, but they all shared that\ncowardice dressed up as strength, they always started\ntheir seduction in the same, brutal way which was so\nfunny because it seemed to leave so little room for\nvariations, it was like reading the same syndicalized\nleader in the same newspaper day out and day in, and\nthe result was always just as uninteresting and clumsily .\noffensive. They thought they were skilful and knew all\nthere was to know about women, and you could put\nup with observing ironically their ridiculous self-\nconfidence as long as it remained within the bounds of\nmoderation and harmless self-deception; but when they\nstarted being insolent and, because of their imagined\nskills, insisted shamelessly on complete surrender to all\ntheir peculiar whims, then she had to call a halt.\n\nAnd my God, it was so easy; the slightest little\nobstacle in the way of the programme they\u2019d planned\nwhich boded no awkward surprises, and they immedi-\nately became irritable and their strength drained away\nas if a plug had been pulled out of their pounding chests.\nAfter all, their programme was intended to run for all\neternity, and there was no room for anybody tampering\nwith it: after a few phrases about the weather, the\nmoonlight, the latest news from the racing circuits, the\nsplendid qualities of the car, her own mouth and her\nown hair, fate had decreed that the next step was to kiss,\n\n102\n", "and so the car came to a halt half a mile short of the\nlittle side road. Five minutes later it was time to turn\ndown it and stop at the little sloping glade fate always\nseems to have planted alongside minor roads suitably\nfar from inhabited areas. In the same old deathly\nsilence, one would return to the car, cold and wet from\nthe grass, and the journey home would soon pass, the\nonly replies one received were inaudible mutterings,\nand one would be dropped off with the necessary degree\nof rudeness outside one\u2019s front door, if one was lucky\nand the garage wasn\u2019t situated in some other part of\ntown.\n\nFaces flicker past like stills from a film as she gazes\ninto the darkness of her cupped hands. Percival, the one\nwith the yellow car, the insufferable bore who always\nwhistled as they got to their feet afterwards; Charles,\nwho died later in some accident involving gas and was\none of the most inoffensive; Lucien, one of the few who\ndrove just as fast on the way out as he did on the way\nback; Henri, who could not help crying like a spoilt\nchild when he was not allowed to be as brutal as he\nneeded to be if he were to make it; Jean, the gentleman\nwho had already achieved middle age and was so afraid\nof his reputation that he forbade her to walk past the\nhouse he lived in, not far from hers; Jacques, young\nJacques, who was so young he thought he knew all there\nwas to know, and was about to be enlightened where\nwomen were concerned. That\u2019s why she was so keen to\nconquer him. All right, he was so sweet when a quiff of\nhair fell down over his forehead and he was too\npreoccupied with something to notice; his eyes were\nnever still for a second, not even when he was kissing\nher, but he was so sure of her, despite the difference in\ntheir age, or because of it perhaps, that he demanded\n\n103\n", "she should submit herself without reservation to his\ntyrannical programme.\n\nThey'd come toa little headland, quite high up and in\nthe middle of the night; water had been flowing down\nbelow on both sides, the air was warm and yet fresh at\nthe same time, the peace was so immense that she hardly\ndared breathe as they got out of the car. Then he got it\ninto his head that the engine should be running all the\ntime, and she protested, gently at first but increasingly\nenergetically. It offended his vanity that she refused to\nsubmit immediately, and so he revved up the engine\nuntil it was roaring like a bull into the night. Then he\ngrabbed her roughly by the arm and pushed her in front\nof him to the tip of the headland, but when he tried to\nforce her down, she just started laughing. She realized\nof course it was the car he really wanted to make love\nto, not her: her gasps and whispered words of passion\nwould be drowned by the roaring of the car.\n\n\u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u2019 he asked; she could feel\nthe tight grip he had on her arm slackening off, and\nnoticed with satisfaction the acrimonious insecurity in\nhis voice.\n\nOf course, she didn\u2019t answer, just carried on laughing\nas before, demolishing his great self-confidence bit by\nbit, and when she was finally convinced he was\nconquered once and for all, she pulled him to her\nurgently and they sank down together. Everything had\ngone as she knew it would; he plucked nervously at her\nclothes, and afterwards he jerked himself violently\naway from her and lay in the grass, abandoned to his\nown sobs.\n\nShe went back and sat in the car, and when he\u2019d\nfinished crying he returned and started the car with a\ntremendous jolt, then hurtled off through the darkness\n\n104\n", "and silence at a hysterical speed, brushing against tree\ntrunks and buckling the right wing and losing a\nheadlight; but Jacques kept on driving like a madman\nuntil they came to the turning from the side road on to\nthe main road when he lost control for a split second and\nthey crashed into a milk lorry which skidded into a\nditch. The smash ripped the door off one of its hinges,\nbut that only made him drive even faster. Strangely\nenough she was quite calm, and it was not until some\ndays later she grew scared when she thought of what\nmight have happened. She realized of course he was\nonly seeking revenge for his defeat, but that he would\nnever be able to achieve it. She was just enjoying herself\ninstead of being scared, enjoying the wind whistling\npast their ears and the black road which seemed to be\nspinning away beneath them. She remembered that\nnight for the rest of her life, and the more frigid she\nbecame, the brighter the halo grew over her night with\nJacques; she adorned the memory with flowers and\ngarlands, built a triumphal arch around it, and the more\nfrigid she became, the higher the arch grew.\n\nBut when she remembered it now on the island, it\nwas not for the sake of her triumph - sorrow comes\nwith great humility \u2014 but because it marked the end of\nsomething and the beginning of something else, the\nbeginning of something which would finally force her\ninto a solitude which was greater than most other\npeople\u2019s, the beginning of something which eventually,\none day at sunset, made her crush an innocent iguana\nwith a heavy, round stone.\n\nNo more cars screeched to a halt outside her front\ndoor, no horns sounded to bring her running to the\nwindow. Apart from a few walks in the immediate\nvicinity together with her housekeeper Mlle Claire,\n\n105\n", "she would spend all her time in an armchair in her room,\nsorting out Paul\u2019s stamp collection or pasting her\namateurish photographs into blue albums, something\nshe\u2019d put off for far too long.\n\nShe\u2019d been standing in Paul\u2019s room with her back\ntowards him the day after the interlude with Jacques.\nShe had tensed her back as hard as she could in order to\nwithstand everything that was now engulfing her, but\nin the end, she was unable to resist any more. It was as if\nher back caved in, she fell to her knees and ground her\nhead red against the windowsill, pressed her burning\nface against the wall in order to avoid the temptation of\nlooking at the cripple in the bed.\n\n\u201cYou must think I\u2019m deaf and dumb, but that\u2019s not\ntrue as you may be aware, what I am is crippled. You\nthink I can\u2019t hear your laughter echoing throughout the\nflat, you think I can\u2019t hear the sweet nothings at the\nfront door, and the young boys in their cars queueing up\noutside.\u2019\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be silly, I\u2019ve never made any secret of the fact\nthat I sometimes go out for a bit of fun. I can\u2019t wander\nabout in this big house on my own all the time.\u2019\n\nPaul started rapping the bed end with his knuckles;\nhe\u2019d found an infernal way of grating on her nerves bya\nrhythmical succession of words, rapping and silence.\n\n\u201cHave your fun, then. But when are we going to stop\nreceiving these anonymous letters from people who\ntake pleasure in tormenting me, and the signed letters\nfrom types who think they might get a reward for\nexposing the spicy situations they ve seen you in? Or the\nanonymous telephone calls, those kind of telephone\ncalls are always anonymous, which torment Mlle\nClaire day in, day out? I didn\u2019t marry a whore, butit\u2019sa\nfunny thing: you don\u2019t marry whores, but one fine day\n\n106\n", "you discover you've got them in the house never-\ntheless.\u2019\n\nMore rapping. Then silence.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you answer? Why don\u2019t you say what\nyou're thinking: I didn\u2019t marry a cripple. No, but you\nmarried an old man, because your father had been\ncooking the books. Shame and disgrace were looming,\nand you were his only chance of salvation, by marrying\na rich man.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, why do you keep on tormenting me with the\nsame old thing?\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not the one who ought to be tormented, you are.\nAnd anyway, you're not going to be tormented, just\npunished. You'll get just punishment this time, but look\nout: next time it might be unjust. And you shouldn\u2019t\nkeep going on about blackmail, not even to yourself; I\ncan read your thoughts, you see.\u2019\n\nMore rapping. Then silence.\n\n\u201cYou know full well it\u2019s not blackmail. Of course, it is\ntrue I won\u2019t let you go without withdrawing all\nfinancial support for your father and his family; but\nonce you're caught, you\u2019re caught \u2014 and that applies to\nboth parties. And then there was some talk about\npunishment. It isn\u2019t even a question of punishment,\ncome to that; it\u2019s just a simple penance for an unfaithful\nwife. You see, my charity is almost boundless, I'm ready\nto forgive almost anything. I expect you know the old\npenance for unfaithful wives: they have to go on their\nknees all round a church, carrying a candle. Well, you\ncan choose your own day and your own time as long as\nit\u2019s this month, that\u2019s how charitable I am. For instance,\nyou could do penance on a rainy day when not many\npeople are around, and so there won't be many who see\nyou. Mlle Claire will go with you as a witness. I\u2019ve also\n\n107\n", "bought a couple of dogs to keep you company so that\nyou won't get lonely in future, and a new caretaker\u2019s\ndue to start work any day now: he\u2019s ugly and has only\ngot one eye, so you won't be tempted to seduce him. As\nyou can see, I\u2019ve only got your best interests at heart.\nBut I really do insist you do your penance, not least in\nview of your father\u2019s financial state.\u2019\n\nThat day she slunk out of Paul\u2019s room with a broken\nback, and it took a very long time to heal, especially as,\nnowadays, she wasted far too much time hunched up\nover postage stamps and photographs. Her skin grew\ngrey and dirty, and the ageing process was rapid and\nruthless. She rarely looked in the mirror any more, but\nwhen she sat in with Paul for a while every morning and\nevery afternoon, her decline was reflected in his\nsatisfied eyes.\n\n\u2018The penance did you good,\u2019 he said, \u2018you ought to go\nto church more often. You don\u2019t need to crawl on your\nknees any more.\u2019\n\nMore rapping. Then silence.\n\nShe planned so many things now, but her knees were\nstill sore after her penance, and her back was far from\nwell again. She thought about the long German bayonet\nhanging on the wall over his bed as she was polishing her\ntarnished memories. But she was on friendly terms with\nthe new caretaker until, one day, she noticed how\neagerly he was watching her with his good eye, how\nintimately, more so with each day that passed. He went\nup to her room whenever Mlle Claire wasn\u2019t at home,\nand one evening he tried to kiss her in the Euridyce\nniche upstairs. She complained to Paul, and he said,\n\u2018That\u2019s right, you fight for your virtue.\u2019\n\nThis period was weighed down by shadows and\ninsidious premonitions, darkness held sway behind the\n\n108\n", "pillars of this vast house, and Claire kept the blinds\ndown in several rooms. She complained that the dust\ncoming in from the street was so awful. Eventually all\ncontact with the outside world was lost, and the house\nstood there like a memorial stone raised over a small\nnumber of living creatures who were barely alive: only\nthe inscription was missing. No one went out of the\ndead house any more, and messenger boys came round\nwith goods which they handed over to Claire or the\ncaretaker on the doorstep; she herself would stand high\nup on the landing, watching wild-eyed as a thin white\nbeam of light filtered into the hall through the crack in\nthe door. She had an enormous desire to scream, not\nbecause she was afraid, but she thought there were far\ntoo many silent rooms in this house. She wandered\nabout imagining which instruments could transform\nthem with music: the cello room, the grand piano room,\nalittle niche for the xylophone. She imagined what kind\nof screams would suit some rooms but be out of place in\nothers; she imagined for instance what a scream would\nsound like in Paul\u2019s room or her own or Claire\u2019s or the\nporter\u2019s cubby-hole.\n\nOne night when everything was quiet in the house\nand outside in the street, and as usual she was lying wide\nawake in her big oak bed, she got the urge to try just a\nlittle scream, to see how it went. She opened her mouth,\nand it was amazing how easily it slipped out. It was a\nlittle bit louder than she\u2019d expected, and she was so\nfrightened when it echoed back at her that she soon fell\nsilent and waited in fear in case somebody had heard it\nand would come racing up to investigate. But every-\nthing was so quiet. So she calmed down again and lay\nthere, trying to remember what it had sounded like. She\ncouldn't quite remember, but she thought it had\n\n109\n", "probably been a little bit too highly pitched for this\ndignified room; but as she didn\u2019t really have more than\none scream as yet, she had to find another room where it\nmight be more suitable. So she crept quietly along the\ncorridor, opening all the doors. She started with the\nlounge overlooking the street, then passed slowly\nthrough the five rooms, screaming in all of them. She\npaused for a while and pondered when she\u2019d finished,\nand decided she\u2019d have to lower her voice at least an\noctave before the scream was anywhere near appro-\npriate for the sobriety and solid good taste characteristic\nof the furniture. She went back through the rooms in\nreverse order, just screaming and listening at the same\ntime to hear whether they would do.\n\nIt still wasn\u2019t quite right. The screams had a vulgarity\nof style that must have been due to her opening her\nmouth too wide, so she\u2019d have to close it slightly when\nshe tried for a third time. But there was no third time.\nMlle Claire and the grim-faced porter came rushing in\nfrom opposite directions, obviously as arranged in\nadvance, knocked her to the ground, stuffed rags into\nher mouth and pinioned her arms. She twisted about and\ntried to spit out the gag so that she could explain it was\nall just a refurnishing exercise, but they were too strong\nfor her, they managed to drug her somehow or other,\nand she woke up one day exhausted and terribly hot,\nand found them standing beside her bed, keeping an eye\non her and each other.\n\n\u2018Madame, we\u2019re going out; we\u2019re going to church,\u2019\nsaid Claire.\n\nThey went to church, but not to the one where she\nhad done her penance. Now she took her hands away\nbriefly, and looked up. Oh, that brick-red colour, that\ncolour which becomes so strangely clear and bitter just\n\n110\n", "as the sun is setting. The tower rose upwards through\nthe domed clouds, the edge of the sun that hadn\u2019t yet\ndrowned, and the sea stretched out as lifelessly as an\netching plate; the tower of the red monastery church,\novershadowing all else, at times dissolving into a\nyellowy-red mist, the mist emanating from blast fur-\nnaces and smithies nestling down in the valleys; but it\nemerges again, rising up from the mists, more recogniz-\nable every time, more lovable, more painful when seen\nfrom so far away.\n\nBut a little lizard crawled out of the massive wall\nand, as insignificant as a beetle, it looked at first as if it\nmight soon disappear into one of the thousands of\ncracks; but look: it started growing, its tail grew longer,\nwas drawn up towards the spire, kept on spreading out\nsideways until its cold shell covered the whole wall. Its\nnasty, thin little head got closer and closer to the\nground, and she slowly slumped forward, transfixed in\na standing position down below, with her hands\nreaching up towards the spire atop the vanished tower.\nShe wanted to yell out: gobble me up, you monster; but\nin her memory-dream, no words crossed her lips.\n\nThen she was standing in Paul\u2019s room again, but this\ntime she had her back turned defiantly towards the\nwindow; her back was completely cured, and light was\ndripping in through the Venetian blinds and clinking\ndown on to the carpet. She knew he was watching her\nwith every segment of his eyeballs, sucking her in,\nalthough he seemed to be lying there, half turned\ntowards the wall and stroking the cruel tip of the\nbayonet.\n\n\u2018I\u2019m going to have a baby,\u2019 she said, hooking her gaze\non to that of somebody else in the far distance so as not\nto fall, \u2018I\u2019m going to have a baby with a priest.\u2019\n\n111\n", "He hadn\u2019t turned round to face her, he was still lying\nin the same position; but she could feel in her skin,\nwhich suddenly became hot, how he was thrusting\nhimself upon her with his eyes, those eyes which were\nnot crippled: they could scratch and bite, they could rip\nand claw, and they could shadow you, sharply and\nruthlessly; wherever you were in the world.\n\nNow the house was closed like a besieged fortress,\nbut it was the house itself which was besieged; its walls\nseemed to be closing inwards bit by bit, the rooms\nbecame more cramped because the ceiling was also\nsinking and the floor rising, it became hard to breathe,\nthe only way was to lie down with your chest as\ncompressed as possible and gasp for air and love, like a\nbeached fish.\n\nAnd then there was the iguana business.\n\nShe was standing in Paul\u2019s room again, no, not\nstanding: she was creeping, creeping painfully slowly\nover the fluffy carpet between his bed and the window,\nand the air was more stifling than ever and the Venetian\nblinds had all been repaired. She couldn\u2019t stand up, as\nthe pressure of hatred and longing, sorrow, despair,\ncruelty that permeated the house immediately knocked\nyou to the floor if you tried to stand up and bear it on\nyour trembling shoulders. His eyes held his hands on the\nback of her neck, but she couldn\u2019t meet their gaze for\nthey were always looking elsewhere, apparently un-\nconcerned about her but always following her around\nthe house, wherever she went. His voice, which had\nbeen shrill and old-mannish for so long, had acquired an\napparently evasive tone, gentle, warm, the timbre of a\nmelancholy cello. But in that tone was a trace of\nacerbity which called forth a special sort of despair in\norder to comprehend it properly, a particular posture;\n\n112\n", "you could only appreciate properly its warm cruelty on\nall fours with your hips sagging and your forehead\nburied deep in the grass of the carpet; it drove wedges\ninto you which stayed, stayed there and swelled up.\n\n\u201cCan you feel the iguana,\u2019 he whispered, \u2018can you feel\nthe iguana growing inside your body? Soon its skin will\nharden, its long tail will get even longer, its eyes will\nstart protruding and there'll be no eyelids; its stiff,\ncallous stare will take root inside you, eating you away.\nCan you see its skull forming? Soon it will be as long as\nit\u2019s going to be, its snout will have no warm lips, but it\nwill press hard and cold against your membranes, trying\nto force its way out.\u2019\n\nOh, she lay there on the floor of Paul\u2019s dark room for\ndays on end, panting, on the fluffy mat between his bed\nand the window, and felt the iguana growing inside her,\nfelt its skin hardening, its long tail growing even longer,\nits lidless eyes protruding more and more, its stare stiff\nand callous inside her, eating her away. She felt its skull\nforming, growing as big as it was going to be, and its\nsnout devoid of warm lips pressed hard against her\nmembranes, trying to force its way out.\n\n\u201cThe iguana,\u2019 she screamed after the birth, \u2018I don\u2019t\nwant to see it, spare me that.\u2019 They brought the baby in\nto her, held her down and yelled into her ear that the\nbaby was normal, that the baby looked like all other\nbabies, that it didn\u2019t have the skin of an iguana, nor\ncould it only crawl on its belly. But she refused to\nbelieve it. Sometimes the door opened suddenly and\nsomebody held up a newly born baby to the light.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not mine,\u2019 she would shout. \u201cYou've swapped it\nfor somebody else\u2019s. Mine\u2019s an iguana.\u2019\n\nThey were afraid she might do the child an injury if\nthey gave it to her, so they let her be alone in her room.\n\n113\n", "All she could remember clearly from that time was that\nsuddenly there was a smell of birch leaves, she could\nhear heavy carts clattering up the street, the sun was\nmore fierce and dazzling than ever before, and without\nher realizing it, she was lifted into summer. It was so\nquiet in the house, but sometimes there was the sound of\nbaking trays falling down in the kitchen and Claire\nwould come up the stairs, heavier and more out of\nbreath for every day that passed. But one afternoon, she\nhad a dream which revealed to her that this silence\ncontained something unknown, it was like a space\nsurrounding a sound she must have been aware of for\nsome time, but the film around it had only burst in her\ndream. There was a child crying somewhere in the\nhouse, shrill and hungry, complaining, then gradually\nfalling asleep; she was lifted straight up into summer as\nif on a wave, delivered at last, restored to health at last,\nand she let the light and warmth embrace her. Her pain\ndisappeared and she was at peace once more, the swell\nfrom her bad dreams rolled over the horizon and\ndisappeared. Good God, she thought, iguanas don\u2019t\nscream.\n\nEven so, she was still a little afraid when they\nwheeled in the pram with the sleeping child, and she\nbent slowly over it ready to close her eyes ina flash and\nsink back once more into her agony. But the child lay\nthere peacefully, its lips were thin, thin, and the blanket\ncovering it heaved gently from its steady breathing; it\nwas not a pretty child, it was too pale and its forehead\nwas depressed in an unusual way, but it was certainly\nnot an iguana.\n\nAnd so her life slowly got under way once more. She\ndidn\u2019t go to Paul\u2019s room any more. They could often\nhear him thumping away on his headboard until the\n\n114\n", "whole house shook; he\u2019d recovered his old-mannish\nvoice and pestered the black serving girl who was\nlooking after him now with threats and invectives until\none day she ran screaming out of his room and out of the\nhouse, explaining she was terrified when the old man\ntried to kill her with the bayonet.\n\nThe boy grew and grew, she hardly left him alone for\na single moment, as if she were afraid something might\nhappen to him, a rapid, brutal transition which would\noverturn her dreams and secret hopes ina flash. She had\nto be near him all the time, and when he\u2019d gone to sleep\nin the evenings and she could hear Paul thumping away\nupstairs in his room, she would bend over him in the\nlight from a table lamp and scrutinize every line, every\nnew shadow and wrinkle in his face; but precisely\nbecause she was constantly examining him for fear of\nsome sudden change, she failed to notice the gradual\nhardening of his features which started to take place\nwhen he was two. She didn\u2019t see how his lips gradually\nstiffened, how his skin grew taut around his jaw and his\neyes slowly turned to ice in their sockets, how his\neyelids acquired a sharp edge and seemed to be about to\nsplit.\n\nThen she fell ill and lay in her room for several days,\ndelirious; everything disappeared behind a green\ncurtain, she tore frenziedly at its shiny folds, behind\nwhich so many voices were laughing, warning, threat-\nening and commanding; but in vain. An alarming\nshadow, long forgotten, was dancing over the curtain;\nat first she couldn\u2019t make out its shape because of the\nshadow\u2019s size, but then she drew back in terror and fell\ndown through years of horror. Shaking, half out of her\nmind with despair, she jumped up in the middle of the\nnight, and raced through all the rooms until she came to\n\n115\n", "the boy; the old nanny woke up and tried to prevent her,\nbut she\u2019d already seen it all: the little shrunken face of\nan old man, finished with life almost before it had\nstarted living, marked by all kinds of experiences,\nalready tired of everything before it had experienced\nanything. With an agonized scream which woke the\nchild up, she ripped back the covers and stared at the\ntiny, deformed body and suddenly realized the awful\ntruth: the newly awakened child didn\u2019t cry, its cold eyes\nwere unaffected by anything that happened, and nothing\nwould ever get through to it; the cold breath of an\niguana soul wafted up towards her, and sent her\nscreaming from the room.\n\nNow she was in Paul\u2019s room again and it was an\nafternoon in autumn, leaves were lying on the window\nsill and the room was suffused with the acerbic smell of\ndecay. She was walking to and fro between the bed and\nthe window, and every time she turned, she stood still\nfor an eternity in an attempt to entice him out of his\ndestructive mood; she could feel he was watching her,\nbut she was no longer singed by his looks, she had\niguana-like armour plating which excluded fire and\ncold, nothing affected her and her armour was growing\ninwards.\n\n*\u2018How\u2019s your iguana?\u2019 he inquired at last, caressing his\nbayonet all the while, \u2018I haven\u2019t heard it crawling\naround for ages.\u2019\n\nShe went over to the door, and when she opened it\nshe could see the boy sitting on a stool by the big\nbookcase; he was seven, couldn\u2019t read, was too old to\nstart talking, too old to take pleasure in anything. He\nwas taking books out one at a time and leafing through\nthem as if to give his fingers something to do. He didn\u2019t\neven pause to look at the pictures, simply dropped each\n\n116\n", "book on the floor beside him when he grew tired of it,\nand when he\u2019d gone through a whole row, he just\nslouched on the stool, his arms dangling, hopelessly\nweary, his back hunched, knees wide apart, his cold\neyes staring through a filter of hopelessness.\n\n\u2018The iguana\u2019s doing fine,\u2019 she said, closing the door.\n\u2018If you give me some money, I'll take him away for a\nholiday and then come back to you, without him, or not\nat all.\u2019\n\nAnd so they set off. Oh, how she suffered when\neverybody stared at them in railway carriages, dining\nrooms, ships\u2019 lounges and customs posts. She could see\nthem glancing quickly at the boy\u2019s body before politely\nlooking away and professing interest in something else;\nbut their looks clung to the boy like burns, he was\ncovered in malevolent eyes, which stuck to his face like\npostage stamps, and when she washed him every night it\nseemed to her the water was full of hostile eyes which\nstayed behind in the bowl like a disgusting scum.\n\nOh, how she hated him when they were travelling in\nthe constant company of strangers. With the cruel aim\nof torturing both herself and him, she would take him\nfirmly by the arm and point out demonstratively all the\nnotable buildings they passed, strange animals in the\nzoos of several cities, which would fill any other child\nwith terrified delight, or peculiar racial types scuttling\nabout in some of the ports; but the boy\u2019s cold stare never\nvaried, nor did his gesture of hopeless disinterest with\nhis right hand, and people who noticed her efforts were\nrewarded by her furtive laughter, and turned away\nwith a smile.\n\nBut when she was alone with him, she noticed to her\npainful surprise that she loved him. When he fell asleep\nat night, she would spread the sheet over his face,\n\n117\n", "fumble for his hand, caress it and kiss it; indeed, she\nfrequently didn\u2019t sleep at all, and in the devout\nconfusion which often sets in after an all-night vigil, she\ngot it into her head that a change, violent and\ncomprehensive, must have taken place in the boy during\nthe night: his old-mannish features had slipped away\nand been replaced by a new, child-like face still full of\nrestlessness and expectations. Gently and with extreme\ncare, she would uncover the boy\u2019s head; but no miracle\nhad taken place under the blankets. Then her frustration\nmade her flushed and she would go out on deck, on to\nthe platform, into the hotel corridor, or wherever, and\ntry to cool down, try to wriggle away from the\ntemptation which always tingled in her finger-ends on\nsuch occasions. Oh, how she longed for some preposter-\nous occurrence, some fantastic experience which would\nengulf them like a heavy sea, some hideous animal\nwhich would appear and force that tightly closed mouth\nto open up, those frozen eyes to crumble around an\nice-hole of honourable horror, that lifeless body to\nshake with pain and despair.\n\nThey\u2019d travelled far into the Orient and her money\nwas running out, but now there was nothing else that\nmattered except this search for the animal, the occur-\nrence and the horror. And then came the storm as they\nwere on their way from Ronton. All of them were\nthrown below decks, shuffled together like playing\ncards, and their qualities seemed to change places and\nwander about from one to another. With a mighty\neffort she tore herself away from the confusion of\nterrified passengers and staggered over the heaving\nfloor to where the boy and the captain\u2019s dog were lying\nat the bottom of the staircase. They were huddled up\ntogether, each of their backs pointing outwards like\n\n118\n", "shields, and through the mist of her seasickness and the\nsoft membrane of her fear she could see how the\nconvulsions shuddering through both bodies were\nidentical, as if they were coming from the same body.\nAh, she thought, now he\u2019s shaking at last, and she felt\nnew hope. With trembling hands, she turned him over\non to his back in the hope of seeing his face distorted by\nhuman fear. Then she collapsed on to the floor in\ndesperation and was forced over towards the bulkhead,\nunable to defend herself against everything bearing\ndown upon her. Oh, his eyes were as cold as an iguana\u2019s\nwhen they turned to look at her, what he was feeling\nwas the fear of an animal. The iguana had sought out the\ndog, and the dog the iguana, the animal the animal.\nWhen the ship ran aground, the bulkhead was split\nopen and the saloon filled rapidly with water; half-\ndrowned and almost blinded, they all waded towards\nthe staircase. Someone was pushed by someone else and\nfell back into the water, gurgling and twisting as he\nsank, and the ship rolled slowly over under the water, in\nthe direction of the hole. No one saw what had\nhappened, they were too busy fighting for their own\nlives on the narrow staircase leading up on deck, lashing\nout with feet, elbows and knees. Her knuckles were\nsore where she'd punched the boy on the chin, and at\nthis moment, standing there on the staircase, that was\nthe only thing she could feel. When they emerged on\ndeck, the storm swooped down on them, masts snapped\noff and bounced over the rail, the men working on the\nlifeboats were repeatedly bowled over by giant green\nwaves surging over them aft, and suddenly the cage\nwith the cook\u2019s parrot was caught up and whirled\naround in circles on the foredeck before being washed\ncruelly overboard. The lifeboat dropped from the\n119\n", "davits at breakneck speed and avoided being smashed\nagainst the starboard hull, but then rolled over and\ndisappeared for no apparent reason. The cook\u2019s white\nhat was whisked around in a series of endless circles on\nthe deck without having the sense to sink, and the next\nshe knew she was falling into this devil\u2019s brew, grabbing\nat the cook\u2019s hat, before everything disappeared as if\nshe\u2019d been given an anaesthetic.\n\nThe whole of her life had consisted of waking up\nafter bad dreams, short periods of good health after long\nillnesses, brief moments of bitter clarity after endless\nanaesthetics. She hadn\u2019t woken up yet, but something\ninside her was awake and preparing by means of far-\nreaching treachery for everything that was going to\nhappen next. There was that high wall of unconscious-\nness stretching from the very floor up to the highest\npoint of the ceiling, and you know everything is\nhopeless, that this wall is the most cruel of all walls as\nwell as the most silent, the only wall in the world that\ncan keep a secret - and yet you have that nagging, silent\nawareness of something happening on the other side,\nwhere there\u2019s the sound of voices, as yet unknown but\neventually identifiable, and other noises, and then that\nthudding, that loud thudding that so uncannily familiar\nknocking - oh, if only the wall would collapse.\n\nShe\u2019s still not sure if she\u2019s awake in fact. As slowly as\na mountain tarn opening up to greet the morning, she\ngradually comes round, warmth presses up against her\nlimbs, she fumbles for something to hide under but can\u2019t\nfind anything as yet and although she already knows the\nawful truth, she turns her aching head towards the cliffs\nand is even so paralysed by the sight; the whole of her\ncliff is covered in large, brown iguanas, motionless in\nthe heat, but new ones are arriving all the time, their\n\n120\n", "bodies smacking hard against the stones. She suddenly\nsenses they are all staring at her, she can feel the whole\ncliff sliding towards her with its dreadful cargo, and\nonce again she slips back in through the protective\nswing doors of her unconsciousness.\n\nThe next time it\u2019s night, a fire\u2019s burning close by and\nshe\u2019s covered by warm cloth; someone is lying beside\nher and seems to be asleep. Someone else is walking\ntowards her across the sand. He stops, bends down over\nher and pushes food into her mouth, gives her something\nto drink; she swallows eagerly and licks her bene-\nfactor\u2019s hand when he\u2019s finished.\n\nAnd then all those dawns, with the thudding of the\niguanas piercing all over her body, those iguana\nmornings, days, sunsets, dusks, evenings and nights.\nOver and over again, she found herself contracting like\na muscle, and would sit motionless, waiting, by the fire,\nunable to feel anything, think anything, say anything.\nShe wanted to mourn the dead boy, but could only\ngrope around the glass roof of her apathy without\nfinding the way in to her sorrow. She wanted to regret\nwhat had happened, but something inside her was not\nfunctioning; she was numb and dumb. Well, what could\nshe do about it?\n\nThen she killed the iguana. That day at sunset,\nwatched by all the other castaways, she wandered up\nthe cliff path towards the plateau, found the stone lying\nin the grass; the iguana emerged from the gloom, was\noverturned and crushed. Why did she do it, why did she\nkill the iguana? Well, in the first place, she had no idea.\nIt wasn\u2019t a plan worked out long in advance and carried\nout suddenly and brutally; when she set out up the cliff\npath, she wasn\u2019t clear about anything, but something\n\n121\n", "was nagging her in the back of her mind, sharp and\nstimulating \u2014 but what?\n\nBut when she was led down from the scene on the\ncaptain\u2019s arm, she could feel this new mellowness inside\nher, this relaxed feeling of liberation from what had\ngone before. I must know what it feels like to kill an\niguana, she thought, I must know that so I can say: I\u2019ve\nnever done it before, I\u2019ve never turned a reptile over on\nits back and found the vulnerable spot on its belly to hit\nwith a stone. In that case, the boy was not an iguana, in\nthat case he was a human being in spite of everything;\nthat\u2019s not what it felt like when I punched him, it was\nmuch cleaner, just that brief soreness in my knuckles\nand then it was all over.\n\nHer sorrow closed in on her, that sweet sorrow\nwhich absorbs everything, consumes everything with\nthe same voracious lust - evil intents and impudent\ndesires, love and hatred; how marvellous it is just to let\noneself sink down and hope to re-emerge whole again\nwhen everything is done, when regret has been satisfied\nand angst has faded away. But even sorrow is treach-\nerous, divers are at work in its depths and thrust their\nlong spades into one\u2019s mud; the memories one has\nallowed to gush forth like tears, innocent and with no\napparent relevance, are suddenly linked to forma chain\nas steadfast as iron, and nothing can be done about its\nruthless, stifling logic. The staircase rising steeply from\nthe saloon to the deck keeps coming back, the handrails\non each side with large, brass knobs at top and bottom,\nand its iron-shod steps resounding to the flurry of\nfootsteps. The dog is always bounding up and down the\nstaircase by the captain\u2019s side, and the boy is sitting in its\nshadow; the boy is always just sitting there, his chin\nresting on his hands, oblivious of the sea: the swordfish\n\n122\n", "have nothing to say to him. Then the lamps start\nswaying in the storm, swinging wildly on their hooks,\nand suddenly there\u2019s a wide crack in the saloon wall,\nand water comes pouring in. How could she stay there\nto the very end, although the water level was rising\nrapidly and the list was making it more and more\ndifficult to force one\u2019s way to the staircase? She stood\nthere on the first step with water almost up to her knees,\nand the boy came wading towards her, and tried to get\npast her; she let him get five steps up before running past\nhim, and then that punch which sent him hurtling\nbackwards into the water below, and it was all over so\nquickly, she hardly realized what was happening\nherself. But suddenly the staircase is empty and long and\nsteep and silent; the image of the empty staircase with\nwater rising swiftly up it pursues her deep down into\nher sorrow, and then she understands that something\nhas to happen to her on account of that empty staircase.\nWhy did she hit him, why did she let him die? If it really\nwas the iguana, the detested iguana, can she mourn\nnow, can she let herself sink down into voluptuousness?\nBut if she has killed the one she is mourning, the knife\nedge must be turned upon her; then it was a beloved\nhuman being who fell down that staircase, killed by her\nown hand.\n\nShe opens her eyes now and sees the horizon\nquivering over where the sun has set, with just a few\ntardy streaks glinting red over the sea and in the English\ngirl\u2019s hair. Then she feels that despair rising inside her\nlike a pillar, and to prevent herself from being split\nopen, so that her own head is not pierced, she stands up\nand rushes up the cliff path, everyone watching her as\nusual, and hastens through the grass where the light of\nsunset is still gleaming like dew on a few blades. Then\n\n123\n", "she sees the lizard lying there, apparently asleep or\nmaking its painfully slow way to somewhere or other.\nThen she sinks to her knees and, with her ulcered lips,\nkisses the iguana\u2019s slowly softening skin, the old\nhypocrite.\n\n124\n", "The Obedience of Twilight\n\nWhen twilight fell, Boy Larus, the airman, liked to\nstand on the highest cliff; only the breeze penetrated\nthat far, and the spot was concealed by undergrowth\nwhich was just turning deep blue as silence engulfed one\nin wave after massive wave. The wound in his groin was\ngetting worse every day, he could feel a nagging\nshooting pain all the time, as if there were two small\nanimals with sharp teeth, each one gnawing away at one\nof his testicles and working its way further and further\nin by the hour. He ran his hand carefully over the\nwounds, but the sensitivity of his fingers which had\nalways embarrassed him, and yet of which he was quite\nproud in private, had been spoilt by the grinding sand,\nthe hard rocks and the corrosive sea-water; all he could\nfeel were a few lifeless calluses, and that couldn\u2019t be\nright. When he crept away to an inaccessible spot and\nhad a look at the wounds, what impressed him was the\nway they seemed to be alive, eating away voraciously at\nhis flesh. He\u2019d hurried back as fast as he could to the\ncamp, all the time aware of how the little animals were\ntriumphantly exploiting his weakness. When he got\nback, he asked Miss Hardlock in a whisper for a length\nof cloth.\n", "\u2018Ihave some wounds that require to be bandaged,\u2019 he\nsaid in halting English, \u2018some rather bad wounds that I\nhave acquired.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 she\u2019d replied, \u201ccan I be of help?\u2019 - and then,\nwhen she noticed his embarrassment and his reluctance\nto say any more: \u2018How much to you need?\u201d\n\n\u2018Oh, not much,\u2019 he\u2019d assured her, and then dis-\nappeared into the grass with his piece of cloth. Of\ncourse, it hadn\u2019t helped; his wounds were not open\nwounds after all, and although they did make him feel a\nlittle warmer, the bandages fell down his leg as soon as\nhe started moving at all strenuously, and in general they\nwere a nuisance.\n\nThe exertions involved in climbing affected him\nbadly, and his condition seemed to deteriorate rapidly.\nHe didn\u2019t dare look at the wounds any more as, when he\nlet his hand venture anywhere near his testicles, he was\nhorrified to discover how quickly they were getting\nbigger. The temptation to look at them was enormous,\nplucking away at his fingers, and at times he had to\nsearch frantically for something to do, spend ridiculous\namounts of energy doing things that didn\u2019t need doing\nat all, just so as not to give way. Apart from that, it\nwasn\u2019t too bad during the day when everybody else\u2019s\neyes, everybody else\u2019s attention prevented him from\ngiving way to his innermost desires; but when it started\ngetting dark and no one could keep an eye on him any\nlonger, it became appallingly difficult.\n\nOf course, you could point out that it wasn\u2019t possible\nto see the wounds when it was dark, at least not as\nclearly as in daylight. At most, all he could make out\nwould be a few dark shadows, much darker than the\nskin of his thighs, standing up slightly in relief. But the\nfact is that while twilight on this island lasts only fora\n\n126\n", "brief second, it\u2019s nevertheless long enough for anyone\nwho\u2019s waiting apprehensively for the opportunity to\nhave a look at two wounds. It\u2019s characterized by an un-\nusually sharp light, a light which is certainly condemned\nto death and is squeezed out of existence by the\ndarkness, but even so its sharpness is awesome; it\u2019s like a\nflash of green lightning, lasting a little longer than the\ntime it takes an ordinary flash of lightning to penetrate\nthe world, and for that lengthy moment, it demands\nthat all secrets be exposed to its ruthless gaze.\n\nIn order to avoid being tormented by this sweet\ntemptation \u2014 sweet yes: it was precisely that strange\nfeeling of painful enjoyment, of persistently agonizing,\ndirty satisfaction, which worried him most \u2014- he\u2019d rush\noff with some excuse or other: he was looking for an\nunusual stone, he wanted to see a particular star which\nwas invisible from their part of the beach, or something\nof the sort; well, rush off is relative, since as the wounds\nwere getting deeper and deeper and at the same time\nbigger and bigger, it naturally became increasingly\ndifficult to walk. It was extremely hard to go uphill,\nespecially when it was a steep slope, but he chose that\ndifficult and exhausting path even so, because once he\u2019d\ngot as far as the little plateau of bare rock about the\nsame size as a skating rink in the middle of the island,\nhigh above everything else, he lost all trace of desire to\nexpose his wounds and caress them eagerly with his\ngaze. He felt as if he were standing in the middle of a\nstage, in the cruel glare of spotlights and watched by\nnaked eyes shackling his movements, binding him fast to\nnormal respectability, preventing him from exposing\nhimself in such a dreadful way.\n\nThe birds were soaring beneath him, their large\nwings like reflectors casting the green light upwards as\nsky and sea merged into one, and the wrecked ship lay\n\n127\n", "slumped over its reef. The big searchlight was still there\non deck, looking like a doubled-up human being; we\u2019ve\nall learnt to conceal our wounds, from ourselves and\nfrom everybody else, to show nothing of our pain, to\nkeep ourselves under control until something gives way\nand we\u2019re bowled over with devilish speed. Everyone\nhas heard about the Spartan boy, with the stolen foxcub\nunder his tunic, who allowed the animal to eat its way\nthrough his chest rather than confess. That was very\ncourageous, and we're all expected to be Spartan boys,\nwe're all expected to let our wounds grow until they\ncover us entirely and no one can whisper to his\nneighbour and say: look, he\u2019s concealing something, but\nhe\u2019s doing it well; it\u2019s admirable, the way he lets his\nwounds grow till they cover his entire body, without\nbothering any of us others with his problems. Not until\nit\u2019s all too late, if you can talk of a thing getting too late\nwhen it was too late right from the very start, only then\nis anyone else allowed to know, and nothing can be done\nabout it, of course, because the wound we carry instead\nof skin always grows inwards, gnawing its way all the\ntime into a tender kernel which will also turn into a vast\nwound, and the kernel inside that kernel, and that\nkernel\u2019s kernel, and all the kernels that all the kernels\nhave inside them, and all the kernels all of us bear inside\nus will turn into wounds, but we\u2019re not allowed to show\nany sign of it until the immense wound we\u2019re carrying\nbursts open and we fall down like a disgusting piece of\nflesh cut off the end of a giant\u2019s finger, and we roll over\nand break open and pus flows in all directions. Then\nwe've kept control of ourselves for long enough, and if\nwe're ruthless now, then it\u2019s the first time after all, for\nsomeone shouted to us as we clambered into the\naeroplane: Right lads, Boy, Esper, Loel, Grenn, when\nyou start dropping your bombs bear in mind the houses\n128\n", "round the power station are close together so if you hit\none of them, the fire will spread rapidly to all the others\nand light up the power station making things more\neffective from a bombing point of view, and the wound\nthat I, Boy, was carrying around inside me nodded\nassent, because it was an obedient wound and it no\ndoubt thought obedience is good for wounds, for a man\nwho just does as he\u2019s told and is faithful to the task he\nwas forced to marry himself to because that year\neverybody with amputated limbs had to be married off\nto people who hadn\u2019t yet had amputations, and so aman\nwho just does as he\u2019s told feels the Spartan boy panting\nthrough the ages with blood pouring from his thin chest.\n\nMaybe he was an ordinary pimply little boy, a bit like\nyou were yourself when you always carried peanut\nshells around with you in your pockets and dropped\nthem wherever you went, in doorways and on landings,\nand of course he would have a Greek profile but his\nshoulders might be thin even so, his back hunched, and\nhe might well have had freckles as he stood there before\nthe stern gentlemen with the fox inside his tunic,\naccused of having stolen it, and determined to die rather\nthan let a confession or a cry of pain pass his lips. He\nmight have just been eating, nuts maybe, or porridge if\nthey had that in those days, and he might have had a\ncrust of dry milk or perhaps even honey on his upper lip\nas he pressed it stubbornly against his teeth with the\nhelp of his lower lip. The stern gentlemen in their togas,\nno, it was the Romans who wore them, they mightn\u2019t\nhave been taking it all that seriously even though they\nwere pretending otherwise, because who could care less\nabout a foxcub and there must have been lots more\nfoxcubs besides this one in ancient Sparta; maybe they\nwere just teasing the boy, pretending to be twice as\n\n129\n", "strict as they really felt like being, and after a few\nminutes of uncompromising sternness they would have\nburst out into guffaws and everything would have been\nrelaxed and the boy would have been allowed to run out\ninto the sunshine, and they would have shouted after\nhim that he shouldn\u2019t take everything so damned\nseriously, only that crowd in Athens were as silly as\nthat, where laws about cruelty to animals and all that\nsilly nonsense spoilt all the fun.\n\nBut before they got round to that, that business of\nletting him go again, the fox trapped in his tunic was\nscratching its way deeper and deeper into the boy\u2019s\nchest, and the blood would have been pouring out under\nhis tunic and if he wasn\u2019t wearing a long coat or an\nankle-length cloak, it would soon have started running\ndown his thighs and down his legs and at any rate some\nof the men accusing him would have seen it and shouted:\nLook, the boy\u2019s bleeding! We'd better help him! Or\nmaybe they would have just let him go on bleeding,\nbecause such things do happen after all, and Loel who\nwas in charge of the machine gun got hit in his arm, it\nmust have split his artery because he turned white\nalmost straight away and slumped forward and there\nwas nothing anybody could do; the battle had started\nand the enemy shells were coming up in waves from\nbelow and suddenly they were screaming vertically past\nus and streaks of flame were flashing by and up above\nthere was a roaring sound as if a gun carrier was running\naway out of control and something big and black that\nlooked as though it was going to gobble up the whole\nearth seemed to be sliding along just over our left wing\nand it couldn\u2019t stop itself before it hit the dam beside the\npower station and in the glow from eight blazing houses\nyou could hear through all the noise from God knows\n\n130\n", "how many different kinds of guns how the burning\nplane was gobbled up by silence and then first a thin,\nblack angry spurt of smoke and then just a big white\ncloud that engulfed everything.\n\nWhile all this was going on, Loel had probably died,\nit would be silly to deny that, and he\u2019d been dead for\nquite a long time when they lifted him out at the airfield\nin Berling and took him without more ado to the\nabandoned garage that served as a mortuary; but you\nmight well say this was war after all, and the Spartan\nboy could no doubt have been saved, because come to\nthat, what kind of a fox was it that didn\u2019t start yelping\nwhen it was being suffocated under that tunic, could it\nhave been a Spartan fox that thought to itself: If 1 can\njust keep quiet for five minutes and instead rip open the\nboy\u2019s chest so that he collapses and dies through loss of\nblood, I\u2019ll go down in history, I'll be a fox that they read\nabout in schoolbooks for hundreds of years to come, a\nreally important fox that'll be of enormous significance\nfor philosophers and for human thought in general, and\nin that case it\u2019s worth my while to keep quite for five\nminutes, because normal foxes just start yelping and the\nfox that I, Boy Larus, had under my shirt when I was\neight and wanted to be famous, he made one hell of a\nrow and everybody in the kitchen started staring at me\nand my Auntie Anna who was operating the separator\nlet go of the handle so suddenly that I remember the\nwarning bell that goes off when you're not pumping\nhard enough started ringing and she ripped open my\nshirt and pulled out the foxcub and I only had a few\nsmall tears in my vest and I got a box on the ears and had\nto go to bed without anything to eat even though I was\nonly doing my best to be courageous.\n\nBut the wound inside me was no less big for all that,\nMum, will you have a look at my wound, but when\n\n131\n", "she'd unfastened my vest and rolled down my socks, my\nskin was unbroken and there was no sign of blood, no\nsign of any abscess or swelling or red patches. Over and\nover again I was exposed asa liar, and eventually: being\nobedient was to keep calm and feel the wound growing,\nto keep the pain bottled up, not to let anybody else and\nin the end not even myself know how the wound was\nspreading, spreading to more and more new parts of the\nbody, and before long the inflammation was necessary\nin order for me to keep on living and living meant\nobeying and obeying meant never wanting anything,\nobeying meant receiving and passing on whatever\ncouldn\u2019t be kept and letting whatever couldn\u2019t be\npassed on stay and form new wounds, obeying meant\nkeeping quiet how sister Betsy was treated by Mum\u2019s\nlover, obeying meant standing with the rest of the class\nby an open grave and singing: \u2018All hail the glittering\nmemory of our nation\u2019s valiant son, His name will live\nin glory for the famous deeds he\u2019s done\u2019, though\neverybody knew that what he\u2019d done was to embezzle\nhis firm\u2019s pension fund and money collected for a new\nhospital and anything else he could lay his hands on, and\nthen obeying meant -\n\nNo, Loel would probably have died anyway, even if I\nhad gone against orders; but what about Brosius? Well,\nwho knows? It was so idiotic when there were only two\npeople in the marker trench, it was so idiotic of Brosius\nto say he would climb up to the target and stick a\nthree-mark stamp over the first hit, because even before\nhe\u2019d got above the protecting mound on his way up, a\nricochet slit his neck open. He was still alive, rolling\nover and over on the ground as if he were having a\nwrestling match, but you couldn\u2019t just run and fetch\nhelp because they were shooting and when they suddenly\n\n132\n", "stopped the only sound to be heard, and heard it\ncertainly was, and how, so shattering and so horrible\nthat he thought his ears would burst, that was the noise\ncoming from Brosius\u2019 dying body as he lay there\nwriggling in the dust like a maggot, rolling over and\nover, over and over again, and when the shooting\nstopped there was somebody yelling down the tele-\nphone: Mark! Naturally, he tried to shout and interrupt\nhim: But, but . . . Mark! And he slammed the receiver\ndown, and he tried to ring back but the telephone only\nworked in one direction and of course it would have\nbeen possible to jump up and shout and tell them what\nhad happened, but who could know whether they might\nstart shooting again straight away and they'd drummed\ninto us that we must never leave the trench until we\u2019d\nbeen ordered to do so and besides: how could anybody\nknow Brosius was in such a bad way when he was\nrolling over and over so violently, as that must mean he\nhad strength left and it was only a little bit painful and\nwhen he just lay there without moving, well, that could\nmean that it wasn\u2019t hurting any more, it was only a\nshort time after all, and the orders said we had to mark,\nand there was probably blood on the bat when he\nmarked, just on the handle, they couldn\u2019t see it from the\nfiring line, but it was on his hands and Brosius was lying\non his stomach, all quiet, and if there\u2019d been time to\nbend over him and see how he was, well, but then they\nwere off again, the whole row, and all twelve targets\nwere riddled at the same time and bits of paper floated\ndown into the trench and the smell of acrid powder\ncame wafting over and up towards the woods, and it\nseemed as if the shooting would never end, the\ntelephone was silent and dead and when somebody\ncame over late in the afternoon to relieve him and asked\n133\n", "how long Brosius had been dead, he said: Oh, about four\nhours.\n\nAnd nobody could believe this perverse indifference,\nthis lack of respect for death, nobody could understand\nhow terrified he'd been and how he\u2019d dashed up and\ndown the marker trench, dragging with him the blood-\nstained bat and his own pitiful despair and his own\nterrible regret and his own harsh cowardice, which he'd\nhad imprinted on his mind \u2018because that\u2019s how it\u2019s got to\nbe\u2019 and because thou shalt obey thy mother and thy\nfather, and all other mothers and fathers all over the\nworld, all commands and superiors, all officials and\nlaws and rules and regulations and native chieftains and\npolicemen and everything which is big and strong and\nhealthy and has muscles, a rib cage, and authority to fall\nback on. He sat in jail working out one defence speech\nafter another, and this would be the authorities\u2019\ndownfall because now if never before it had been\nproved how inhuman and how cruel, how deadly cruel,\nliterally, the authorities were when they forced him to\nstay put and mark while his comrade was bleeding to\ndeath, but in court he cut a sorry figure and couldn\u2019t\nunderstand at all why everybody maintained it would\nhave been so easy to shout when he\u2019d had that telephone\ncommand: Hallo, there\u2019s been an accident, you must\nstop the shooting for a minute, and nobody seemed to\nunderstand he couldn\u2019t do that because it\u2019s strictly\nforbidden to reveal your wounds to anybody else or to\nyourself. The hypocrites just sat there in their gilded\nmasks and accused him of this and that and the other\nalthough they knew full well they'd have done just the\nsame in his place!\n\nBut they never were in his place, that was the strange\nthing about it: he was always the one it happened to,\n\n134\n", "nobody else got in the kind of ridiculous situation he\ndid, he was always getting into the most absurd\nconflicts and then everyone would say he'd acted in\nsuch a stupid way, maybe he was born unlucky because\nthey couldn\u2019t say of anybody else in the regiment,\nindeed, probably not in any other regiment in the\nworld, and probably nowhere else in the world full\nstop, that because he was so frightened of making a\nmistake and even more frightened of being disobedient\nthat he would call out the guard when the most\ninsignificant person came into view in the distance, for\ninstance, or that he would give his superiors quite\ndifferent and of course much more important titles than\nthey actually had. No, he wasn\u2019t born unlucky, and once\nhe\u2019d got over the worst, when he'd managed to\ndiscipline his urge to obey, and loyalty encircled his\ninner kernel like a nutshell, everything grew better and\neasier to bear, and he threw himself into all the tasks\nassigned to him with commendable enthusiasm.\n\nHe can still remember very clearly that parachute\nthat needed testing, it required fifty-eight stages from\nwhen you put it on to when ycu actually jumped, and he\nknew them all so perfectly, more perfectly than anyone\nelse, and he counted the seconds mechanically as he\napproached the door where they were leaping out one\nafter another with their arms spread out and then there\nwas that time when he was on a commuter tram, maybe\nit was hot or maybe the sliding door was open for some\nreason or other, anyway, there he was pressed tightly\nagainst the wall and in front of him stood a man with a\nrucksack looking very much like a parachute, and the\nman moved quickly to one side and disappeared from\nview and suddenly Boy was in an aeroplane, he started\ncounting to himself and closed his eyes as usual as he\n\n135\n", "staggered the few paces to the door and he grabbed the\nframe to give himself a thrust outwards and he\u2019d\nalready let go and was just about to jump when\nsomebody grasped him hard by the shoulder and\ndragged him violently back in again. It was a most\nembarrassing situation, nobody would believe him if he\nsaid he thought he was in an aeroplane, because how\ncould you possibly confuse an aeroplane with a tram,\neverybody asks. This man just tried to commit suicide,\nsays the tubby little man who'd saved him, inflating\nhimself with his own splendid performance, but I\nmanaged to grab him at the last moment, and all the\npassengers stand up and stare at him in disapproval, and\ntheir lips curl in silent contempt as if to say: You go off\nand commit suicide if you want to, young fellow, but\nnot while we\u2019re here, we don\u2019t want any blood and we\ndon\u2019t want to give evidence or any of the other\nunpleasantnesses that go with such an occurrence \u2014 and\npoor Boy had to get off at the next stop.\n\nThat\u2019s the way it is with disobedience, it can so easily\nturn the tables on you, it\u2019s so practical for everybody\nelse but very rarely for you, it forces you to do the most\noutrageous things, and then you get into a fix and you\ncan\u2019t blame somebody else because nobody will believe\nyou anyway. How on earth could you get such a daft\nidea into your head, they ask with a sneer. I was only\nobeying orders, you reply without sneering, just obeying\norders. But that\u2019s impossible, they say, there aren\u2019t any\norders like that, and if there aren\u2019t any such orders, who\nwere you obeying, God or the devil or some other devil?\nAfter that really witty punch line they start guffawing\nand take no notice of any assurances you give which are\na waste of time in any case. They don\u2019t see the wound\nthat\u2019s starting to spread all over you, the wound that\n\n136\n", "starts just under your collar, leaves your head and your\nbare hands free but apart from that spreads all over your\nbody.\n\nBoy Larus wandered around in the dusk on the stony\nplateau the size of a skating rink to which he had to flee\nwith his groin wounds in order to avoid the temptation\nof looking at them, enjoying them, tasting the agonizing\npain they provided. Meanwhile, the great flash of\ntwilight that was hurled through the world singed away\nthe little island where six human beings were being\ntortured together, by their hunger, their thirst, their\nsorrow, their paralysis. Nights came and went, days\ncame and went, but hunger, thirst, sorrow and paralysis\ncame back refreshed every morning; he saw hopes born,\nbitter furrows growing deeper, beards growing longer\nand more brutal, bodies becoming dirtier and smellier,\nhair growing shaggier and wilder, faces slowly but\nsteadily shrinking as hardships increased, clothes\nhanging looser and being shredded bit by bit by the\nisland\u2019s sharp edges, backs growing more rounded and\nsubmissive, eyes more defiant and crazed from lack of\nsleep and lack of hope, skins rougher, more sunburnt\nand covered more and more in nasty spots, feet growing\nmore blood-stained and more careless about where they\ntrod, words becoming fewer and more blood-stained\nand more careless about where they trod, arms thinner\nand ever more helpless, elbows more pointed and\npitiful, skin stretching over hip-bones, kneecaps, ribs,\ncollar-bones, elbows, finger-joints, knuckles, nasal\nbones, temples, frontal bones, jaws, cheek-bones,\nvertebrae, shin-bones, thigh-bones, wrists, pelvises and\ncrania\u2014 but even so he felt he was in another world, like\naman lost in a menagerie: maybe he won't find his way\nout before dusk falls, but sooner or later the caretaker\n\n137\n", "will turn up; he raced around between the locked cages,\nhoping they were locked at least, and searched in vain\nfor the exit while the lion roared and heavy snakes\nrattled behind their glass screens, monkeys howled\nfrenziedly, relentlessly, shrilly, and a solitary tiger\nraged somewhere in the darkness. Indeed, he was\nalways backing off from the wild animals staring at him\nfrom his companions\u2019 eyes, from their faces and bodies.\nThere seemed to be no barriers holding them back, no\nwounds too shameful to display, their ruthlessness\nterrified him so much he felt like screaming, so that he\ntoo could feel this wild urge to tear off his clothes and\nbellow: look, I\u2019ve also got wounds that hurt, spreading\nall over me, sinking into me, driving me mad with\nagony. Look at them with your greedy eyes, feel them\nwith your greedy hands, kiss them with your greedy\nlips.\n\nOh, how scared he was of them, and how comforting\nit was to feel the green flash and its surging heat sweep\nthem out of this world, from this wonderful world of\nshattered hopes, disciplined coolness, and vacuous\nfreedom from problems. He walked over to the mound,\nwhich looked as if it might have been made by human\nhand as a bulwark, so regular was its height over the\nrock, so carefully was it thought out as a protection for\nsomeone afraid of a rear attack, a surprise attack and\nany other kind of treachery. It ran round a third of his\nplateau and had red streaks like no other stones on the\nwhole island. On top of it were mysterious black\nhollows looking like some strange form of box; he tried\nto work out what could have been pressed into the rock\nonly to be squashed just as everything stiffened up. He\ntook a little stone and knocked inside the boxes, but\nnowhere was the stone as hard as it was here, and all he\n\n138\n", "could do was produce a few shallow little scratches.\nThen he ran his fingers slowly over the contours, closed\nhis eyes and tried to shut out everything except his\nfingers, to force his senses through the hard outer shell\nand find out what there was living inside there, to try\nand hear the music that must be trapped inside, still\nbeing sung even after millions of years in captivity.\n\nBut he himself was dead, his fingers were so\ninsensitive, their skin felt like sandpaper, and his ear\ncould hear nothing, apart from the soughing of the wind\nas it drifted along the autostrada of the dusk.\n\nOh, those fingers of his, they used to be so long and\nsensitive. You'll see, my dear, you'll be a musician when\nyou grow up, said all too many people; to be sure, he had\nbecome quite an artist on the machine gun and had the\nlongest fingers in the whole company. There was a\ncertain tune in the aeroplane, no, not in the aeroplane\nbut in the air round about it, which reminded him of a\nmelody he\u2019d once heard at a funeral, and it came just\nwhen they had to bank and gain height at the same time.\nNow his ears weren\u2019t much good either. He kneeled\ndown and stroked the stone, listening for the captive\nvoice even though he knew how pointless it was.\n\nThen he came to with a start, for something was\nmoving fast just below him, something was on its way\nup to him, something indescribably horrible, something\nthat wanted to leap on top of him and bite off all these\nmembranes anchoring him to life. He looked up, but it\nwas only the smoke from the fire down below which\nhad changed direction, the green dusk had acquired\nlong, black shadows sailing through it, darkness was\nseeping in from all sides and the dazzling white smoke\nwavered gently and floated slowly up towards him in\nwisps. He looked down at the camp, the grass and the\n\n139\n", "tall bushes were in the way; the ship was slumped as\nusual over the reef, however, and the strange green\nlight was still dallying in the undamaged portholes, the\nfunnel was leaning over the bridge and seemed to be\ninvolved in intimate conversation with the mast, which\nwas leaning backwards, broad-chested and as yet\nunbowed, a solid countryman sniffing the morning\nweather with hands in pockets, and the cook\u2019s hat had\ngot caught on a wire and was fluttering backwards and\nforwards as if looking for a head to settle on. The water\nwas still shimmering slightly but obviously sensitive to\nthe falling darkness, and he thought he could see some-\nthing floating towards him; he was suddenly scared and\ntried to close his eyes, but they refused to obey. Some-\nthing drifted slowly forwards about a hundred yards to\nstern: was that white patch a human being, or a part ofa\nhuman being slowly surfacing on an undercurrent?\nOh, how terrified they all were at the thought of the\nmoment when the lost souls would return and be\nwashed up on to their beach, bringing with them all the\nrecriminations of the dead faced with those who had\nbeen saved at their expense: what would happen then?\nThe sea never reclaimed its dead, it wasn\u2019t like\nthrowing a stone out to sea in the knowledge that it\nwould sink and never be heard of again; you couldn\u2019t just\nthrow dead bodies back where they came from, the way\nback would be barred, and you couldn\u2019t escape the stink-\ning accusations in the shallows off the beach, that threat,\nthat eternal reminder of your own imminent death.\nThen the white object swung slowly round ina series\nof circles and was lit up brilliantly and briefly as the\ngreen light died away, and he could see it was a white\nbird drifting into land with the tide. Then there were\nthose steps he was frantically trying to defend himself\n140 |\n", "against, but there they were even so; it wasn\u2019t just the\nsmoke tickling his nose, it was heavy footsteps crunching\nin the grass, beating through the undergrowth, padding\nover the hard rock, pausing for amoment as if in doubt.\nHe crept back behind the bulwark, desperately trying\nto protect himself from this new threat, but after what\nseemed an eternity of agonizing waiting, they continued\nup towards him, apparently hesitant, but never in doubt\nabout their goal. And all the things he\u2019d tried to run\naway from by leaving the camp and the six people on\nthe beach and everything they symbolized in the way of\nexecutioners and nagging certainties and constant\ndoubts about himself and all the rest of it leapt over the\nbulwark and stabbed him viciously in the back of the\nneck till he lay gasping, outstretched on the naked rock,\nhimself more naked than ever, and of course Loel\u2019s\nhands were more attractive than his and everybody\nmade fun of him because he was so sensitive, his ears\nwere always burning and always seemed to be trembling\nin some secret draught and then he said the last night,\nthat last night before it all happened, and they were all\npulling his leg as friends do because he couldn\u2019t stop\nbrushing his teeth, no matter what was happening or\nwhat was going to happen: I have to brush my teeth, just\nthink if I dream of my fianc\u00e9e and I\u2019m going to kiss her;\nand then when he lay slumped behind his machine gun\nand the life was draining out of him and maybe, or\nmaybe not, but maybe something could have been done\nif only somebody had been as brave as people after-\nwards suggested he should have been, but he was dead\nwhen they got back to the airfield and two or three of\nthem lifted him out, he was so still and his lips had\nparted and showed his lovely white teeth which weren\u2019t\nreally as white as you might have expected.\n141\n", "Then there was this obedience business, was it really\npossible as people said to be brave at the same time as\nyou tried to obey all the orders you were given, all\ninstructions and company orders and tables dealing in\nall aspects of life, because the fact is that if you don\u2019t\nobey you don\u2019t dare to live properly, it was so\nridiculously easy to make a mistake every time you tried\nto do something off your own bat and so you didn\u2019t dare\nto do anything people might think was idiotic, the fact is\nthat right from the start you'd learnt how necessary it\nwas to have doubts about yourself and rely on somebody\nwho was right, who knew more than you did and could\ntell you and would tell you what to do and if anybody\nhad killed Loel, it wasn\u2019t him, if Preses who was Loel\u2019s\nbest friend shouted that Boy killed Loel, that wasn\u2019t fair\nand Boy had the right to cry as he did do in fact, and to\nroll around on the mess carpet with pain surging\nthrough his body in a series of convulsions.\n\nAnd he himself, he\u2019d loved Loel so much, liked Loel\nso much for his sensitivity, a sensitivity Loel dared to\ndisplay, and which Boy also had but never dared to\ndisplay, and that last night before it all happened, and\neverybody was pulling Loel\u2019s leg because as always, no\nmatter what had happened and no matter what might\nhappen, Loel had said with that innocent sincerity of his\nthat was always so frank and so sincere: I must brush my\nteeth in case I dream about my fianc\u00e9e and have to kiss\nher, she\u2019s so particular about things like that, and later\nwhen they lifted him out of the aeroplane and every-\nthing inside Boy was so numb and silent, he\u2019d noticed\nLoel\u2019s teeth weren't as white as he'd always thought,\nbut all yellow like in people who smoke a lot, and in the\nmidst of his indifference he'd felt a noticeable pang of\nsatisfaction.\n\n142\n", "Yet, the footsteps were getting closer, the stranger\ntook hold of the top of the bulwark and then that\nwheezing which suddenly wafted over him and when he\naccepted he\u2019d been found out and looked up, the captain\nput his other hand on the bulwark and wheezed again\nafter the strain of it all. He pulled himself up with great\ndifficulty, he\u2019d picked a particularly difficult place to\nclimb over in fact, and he sat astride the bulwark for a\nmoment with his shiny jackboot on the right side; he had\nabout him a little of the twilight which was almost over\nas it was squeezed more and more by the darkness, he\nhad a little of that pale green light on half his forehead,\nhis deep-set eyes, his cheek covered in stubble and on\none side of his neck a vein had swollen up and looked as\nif it might burst at the slightest provocation.\n\nThe captain dangled his boot on the plateau, kicking\nslowly as he\u2019d got plenty of time, and in a way designed\nto calm Boy Larus\u2019s nerves. Boy rose to his feet in\nconfusion and suddenly felt the wounds in his groin flare\nup but before he had time to show any pain the fear that\nhad just shot through him disappeared and he turned to\nthe captain, calm and without giving anything away,\nand said, \u2018Aha, the captain\u2019s also taking a look at the\nworld I see.\u2019\n\nAnd he looked round, round the plateau, out over the\ndark grass and the sea which was still streaked with a\nfew narrow, painfully extended, deep green stripes, and\nthe sky looming darkly over the sea, threatening to\nsuffocate it, as if it were the whole world, and a few\nstars twinkling here and there like little red fireflies in\nthe night over the black rushes.\n\n\u2018Larus,\u2019 said the captain, still kicking away at the\nrocky ground, the iron clinking regularly if somewhat\nnonchalantly against the stones, \u2018Larus, you're keeping\nsomething back from us.\u2019\n\n143\n", "\u201cBut captain, I can assure you, please let me assure\nyou...\u2019\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t want to say anything before. I thought: well,\nwe've all got our own little ways, perhaps one can\u2019t\nexpect everybody to submit themselves to the organ-\nization, although I\u2019ve always been absolutely convinced\nthat an efficient organization demands the submission\nof all concerned, everybody must do his bit. So, I\u2019ve\nbeen tolerant, I\u2019ve told myself there may perhaps be\nsomething in his tale about a stone he\u2019s looking for,\nperhaps it\u2019s an innocent enough hobby that no one can\nbegrudge him, although I must say, Mr Larus, that the\nsituation is extremely worrying. Indeed, I have to say\nI\u2019ve been turning a blind eye on your tendency to go\nyour own way.\u201d\n\nBoy Larus looked down on the man balancing on his\nbulwark, his own bulwark, which he'd discovered with\nhis own eyes. He was tall, but not so tall that you\u2019d\nremember him for his tallness; his body was thickset on\nthe whole and his specific weight seemed to be quite\nconsiderable, his shoulders could have been borrowed\nfrom a marble statue, so brutal and so well formed and\nso cold; and then that face, used to giving commands but\nwith a constant hint of worry from the corners of his\nmouth and down towards his chin and the same\ntendency around his eyebrows and that line running\nfrom the root of his nose before losing its way in the\nnetwork of lines around his mouth. But none of this was\nwhat he feared most, those haggard faces which had\nconceded defeat to hunger and allowed all previously\nhidden secrets to seep through. Already he felt drawn to\nhim by a remarkable feeling of sympathy, no, not all\nthat remarkable because the only person he might\npossibly still be able to tolerate had come to seek him\n", "out, a person who may well have had wounds of his own\nbut kept them hidden, a person he would be glad to\nobey, the only person who still wanted him to obey, the\nperson who could still rescue him.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both military men,\u2019 said the captain; it was\nalmost completely dark now, and the iguanas down\nbelow were rattling their way into their sleeping\nquarters. \u201cWe're both used to discipline, and we know\nwhat it means. Please, do sit down: we\u2019re going to have\na little talk.\u2019\n\nBoy Larus sat down on the bulwark; it was uncom-\nfortable, but he didn\u2019t dare sit in any other way. He was\npleased at having been rescued, proud of the opportunity\nto obey this man who was still kicking his jackboot on\nhis plateau. He knew just how well tended this boot\nwas, how he always felt every time he polished it with\ngrass and sand and leaves with what admirable care the\nmakers must have constructed it, it was as well made as\na city hall with rooms for all imaginable occasions, as\nharmoniously conjoined as a musical instrument, and\nyet so hard and brutal in a completely natural way, like\na beast of prey.\n\n\u2018Come a bit closer,\u2019 said the captain, moving closer\nhimself. \u2018I remember once in Verdisse, we'd set up\ncamp on a hill near a church, and started a fire near the\nchurchyard wall, just a little fire, made of leaves and a\nfew branches, nothing much to warm yourself by, but it\nmade a cosy glow and the plains around Verdisse are so\ndamned lonely. We felt as if we were all on our own,\nnot just in Verdisse but in the whole world; it was\nautumn, and it was dark, and I had that fire made so that\nwe wouldn't feel so damned lonely.\u2019\n\nBoy Larus listened respectfully to the prattle about\nthe fire, that fire at Verdisse which must have been a\n\n145\n", "remarkable fire since the captain said so, but he was\nonly showing respectful interest; the last strips of\ntwilight were now breaking up, just a few faint glows\ncould be seen on the swirling sea which sounded deeper\nnow as if a lid had been placed over it and one was\nstraining one\u2019s ears to hear the sound under that lid. And\neverything was cleaner and better now, the two little\nanimals in his loins could gnaw away to their hearts\u2019\ncontent now, he was no longer tempted to eye them\nvoluptuously and feel the the same ruthless, primitive,\nanimal-like expression of abandonment in his features\nlike several of his companions, no, not companions:\nfellow-survivors.\n\nMore and more stars emerged into the conquering\nnight, unsure whether they should stay there or fade\naway again; he stroked the hollows in the bulwark and\neverything was calm and silent; he tried in vain to pick\nup the hidden melody under the stone, but he was\nstartled by a low but nevertheless crystal clear signal\nwhich made him feel uncomfortable. He was not sure at\nfirst where it was coming from and started tapping the\nbulwark nervously with his knuckles in a state of\nextreme uncertainty. Then he fell silent and started\nlistening intently to the captain, and noticed immedi-\nately the new tone that had crept into his voice,\naffecting his speech as if a jammer had started inter-\nfering with a radio station and almost obliterated the\nnormal programme and making it irrelevant: the main\npoint was now the jammer. He was still going on about\nthe fire at Verdisse, how as the night wore on they had\ntaken the blankets from the horses and burnt them, and\nscraped the bark off a maple to keep the fire going, and\nplucked grass from off the hill, taken oats from the horses\nand cotton waste from the mechanics to keep it alive.\n\n146\n", "When Boy Larus made as if to stroke the hollow\nbetween him and the captain, he suddenly felt his hand\nburning from below and pulled it back quickly as ifhe\u2019d\ntouched a red-hot stove.\n\nThen suddenly, the captain stopped talking about the\nfire, broke off in the middle of a sentence and said,\nquickly and rather nonchalantly, \u201cYou\u2019re keeping some-\nthing back from us, Larus. You\u2019re keeping something\nback from me. Why do you come up here every night?\u2019\n\n\u2018Captain, don\u2019t make me talk about that, it\u2019s too\ndifficult.\u2019\n\n\u201cMy friend, we\u2019re both soldiers, aren\u2019t we? As we\u2019re\nboth soldiers in the same army, we shouldn\u2019t have any\nsecrets from each other.\u2019\n\nHe suddenly swung his canvas leg over the bulwark\nand sank down on to the plateau at Boy\u2019s feet.\n\n\u201cCaptain,\u2019 said Boy, and everything was closing in on\nhim, he felt he had to obey before something even worse\nhappened. \u2018Captain, if you have a wound, if you have\n@. os if you havea si.\u2019\n\n\u201cCome on, out with it my friend, there\u2019s no need to be\nfrightened of me.\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, if you have a wound, if you have a wound\nsomewhere on your body, a big wound you feel is just\ngetting bigger and bigger, what is best ina case like this:\nto keep it secret or to find a confidant you can show it to\nand get advice and help?\u2019\n\n\u2018To find a confidant.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut captain, if there\u2019s nothing you can do aboutit, if\nyou yourself are well aware the wound can never be\nhealed no matter what, what\u2019s the point of showing it to\na close friend?\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, there are always good reasons. You can never be\nsure about wounds. The worst-looking ones can be easy\n\n147\n", "to cure if you get the right treatment; other types of\nwound that seem minor, not much more than a bit of\ninflammation in fact, can be the worst kind and just\nspread inwards.\u2019\n\n\u2018In my case both types apply,\u2019 said Boy. \u201cThey look\nawful, it\u2019s really a question of two wounds which both\nlook equally awful, and both of them are growing\ninwards.\u2019\n\nThe captain lay back on the rock and started kicking\nthe bulwark, not loudly, but regularly and unnervingly.\nThen he raised his head and rested it on his hand.\n\n\u201cWhere are they?\u2019\n\nThis tone, this jammer breaking in and provoking\nresistance.\n\n\u2018Captain,\u2019 said Boy, \u2018I can\u2019t tell you that, I can\u2019t tell\nyou that, captain.\u2019\n\nA few periods of eternity ensued; there was a smell of\nsmoke again, acrid and irritating, and a group of birds\nswooped down over the plateau, their wings beating\nurgently, round and round, as if they were on an\nexercise. The captain rolled over on to his side and\npounded on the rock with the palm of his hand.\n\n\u201cWhich squadron did you belong to, Larus?\u2019\n\n\u2018Seventeenth west, based at Weston, CO: Colonel\nTolov.\u2019\n\n\u2018You were moved when war broke out, weren\u2019t\nyou?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, not straight away. We were in Weston for a\nyear and a half; guarding convoys was our main duty.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut you eventually moved to a base on one of the\nislands out here, didn\u2019t you?\u2019\n\n\u201cYes, in the end twelve per cent of the original\nsquadron was moved there; to an island called Brondona\nin fact. It looks like a horseshoe on the map, and the\n\n148\n", "aerodrome was surrounded by both arms of the horse-\nshoe. It was a pretty efficient harbour, come to that,\nprotected by long, high breakwaters.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat were you doing there, then?\u2019\n\n\u201cReconnaissance. There were rumours of a fleet\nassembling in the channels around Ronton, but as usual\nthere was lots of smoke and little fire. We didn\u2019t do\nmuch good to tell you the truth, just a couple of sorties\nevery week, and the rest of the time it was gymnastics\nand fencing, eating and games.\u2019\n\n\u201cWho was your commander on Brondona?\u2019\n\n\u201cCaptain Simmon, captain.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen were you attacked then?\u2019\n\n\u2018It was at dawn, the twelfth of January this year.\u2019\n\n\u201cWas it just at dawn and not during the night?\u2019\n\n\u2018No captain, just at dawn. They came out of the mists\nand bombed the station, and part of the fleet that had\nclosed in during the night sailed into the harbour.\u2019\n\n\u2018The attack came as a complete surprise?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, absolutely. There was a bit of resistance when\nthey landed, but that was overcome more or less\nstraight away.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou were all taken prisoner, then?\u2019\n\n\u201cYes, more or less everybody apart from eight of us\nwho were killed in the bombing, three who were shot\nduring the landings, and Captain Simmon and a\nlieutenant called Osp who committed suicide in the HQ\nbunker.\u2019\n\n\u2018And then you escaped. Yes, you\u2019ve told me about\nthat before. You found a sailing boat to take you to\nRonton, and caught this boat to get you to the\nseventeenth squadron on Rivinos. Is that right?\u2019\n\n\u201cYes, captain.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, as I say, you told me all this the very first day,\n\n149\n", "and everything fits in with what you say. Everything\nfits in so incredibly well, it all fits in so well it sounds as\nif you've learnt it all off by heart so that you can give all\nthe right answers in convincing fashion if anybody\nshould be so cheeky as to ask.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, captain?\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, I mean there\u2019s something about all this that\ndoesn\u2019t make sense.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, captain?\u2019\n\nHe suddenly felt in dire need of support and slid down\nfrom the bulwark, leaning hard against it with his back.\nHe pressed his back hard, hard against the stone and\ntried to sink into it, but was rejected coldly. He was so\nextremely hot inside, but felt cold even so.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said the captain, sitting up and blowing out\nair as if he were smoking, \u2018when I started thinking about\nthis business, there was something that just didn\u2019t fit in.\nI remembered a certain picture I\u2019d seen in a certain\nnewspaper when we sailed from Ronton, with several\nemaciated prisoners from the camp you say you were\nstationed at. They'd stolen a sailing boat and landed on\nan island north of Ronton called Bellos. There was\nnothing remarkable about them at first glance, they\nwere considerably thinner than you are, but that\nneedn't be very significant. But if you held the paper\nsteady and looked really closely at them, there was\nsomething special about them you noticed, and quite\nrightly the article commented on it: they were all\nwearing enemy uniform - and why? Well, quite simply\nbecause the prisoners\u2019 own uniforms had been burnt, in\naccordance with the old tradition of trying to squeeze\nout of them the last dregs of resistance. Now you are\nwearing a uniform with the flashes of the seventeenth\nsquadron. Unfortunately I don\u2019t have the newspaper\n\n150\n", "with me here, I expect it got left behind on the boat -\nbut if -\u201d\n\n\u2018Yes, captain,\u2019 said Boy, and everything collapsed:\nhimself, the plateau and the island and the world, and he\nwas consumed by dizziness, \u2018yes, I\u2019m a deserter.\u2019\n\nThe captain didn\u2019t need to stretch far in order to slap\nBoy\u2019s face, three quick slaps like whiplashes, and he fell\nback along the bulwark gasping as the sensuous darkness\nswallowed him up, only to spit him out violently and\ncruelly once more. The captain was leaning over him,\nbreathing heavily, and Boy noticed for the first time the\nacrid smell of sweat emanating from his body and from\nhis words and his breath,\n\n\u2018Now I\u2019ve got you,\u2019 he said. \u201cNow I\u2019ve got you.\u2019 And\nhe added in a whisper, \u2018Show me your wounds, where\nare your wounds, you must show me them now.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s so dark, captain, can\u2019t we wait till it gets light? In\nmy groin, in my groin.\u2019\n\nHe scrambled warily to his feet, gave the captain a\nlittle push and flung himself over the bulwark and down\ninto the darkness and the silence. He slithered noisily\ndown the slope, it sounded as if the earth was opening\nup beneath him, and landed at the bottom, then tried to\ncrawl away into the sheltering grass. But the captain\ncaught him and helped him to his feet.\n\n\u201cBe careful,\u2019 he said reproachfully, \u2018you shouldn\u2019t\nwaste your strength in silly ways like this.\u2019\n\nThey walked into the grass together, and it closed\ngently over their heads like a gigantic wave.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t mean you any harm, I just want to have a look\nat your wounds.\u2019\n\nBoy Larus tore himself violently away from him and\ntried to escape, but one of those treacherous potholes\nthat were everywhere and which the iguanas often used\n\n151\n", "as a refuge at night caused him to fall, something\nscreamed in acute pain and clattered away into the\ngrass.\n\nBoy Larus was so scared of the darkness and of that\nmysterious scream and of all that was happening to him,\nalthough it hadn\u2019t yet happened. \u201cThey're my wounds,\u2019\nhe yelled, \u2018Leave me alone, get away from me. I know\nyour type. I know what was going on ina certain library\nat the Brosto garrison shortly after midnight when the\nfire had gone out and the armchairs were pushed\ntogether in pairs and there was whispering and panting\nbehind the locked doors. What do you want with my\nwounds? I can assure you, there\u2019s nothing to see, just\ntwo ordinary wounds. What do you want to do with\nthem? Let me feel the pain myself, they\u2019re mine, mine,\nnot yours, go and stroke your own wounds instead.\u2019\n\n\u201cYou should take this in a different way,\u2019 said the\ncaptain, kneeling down beside him in the grass. \u2018Don\u2019t\nget so excited, calm down a bit, there\u2019s nothing\noutrageous about what I want to do, and anyway: I can\norder you to do it, I can give you an order and you must\nobey.\u2019\n\n\u2018Obey!\u2019 he whimpered. \u2018As if I haven\u2019t obeyed\nenough! Haven\u2019t I obeyed all of you, haven\u2019t I always\ndone what I didn\u2019t want to do, what I found so horrible,\nthings that hurt so much I wanted to die?\u2019\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t die.\u2019\n\n\u201cEverything people shouted at me, funny how they\nalways shouted at me, never requested, I did everything\npeople shouted at me I should do. You always said\nthings were going wrong, everything was collapsing,\nthe system won\u2019t work if you don\u2019t obey - and I obeyed\nall right and the system didn\u2019t collapse, but there was\nsomething inside me that did collapse. I got a wound \u2014\u2019\n\n152\n", "\u2018It\u2019s not bleeding.\u2019\n\n\u2018I got a wound that just grew and grew, but you\ndidn\u2019t care about that when it still wasn\u2019t too late, you\ndidn\u2019t demand to see it then, you didn\u2019t shout then that I\nshould kindly show us all your wounds, please, we're all\nso interested in wounds, especially the kind that still\nhaven\u2019t turned nasty. You just let it go on growing\ninside me and outside me and through me and round\nabout me and I did everything you told me to do just so\nthat I could forget about the wound under my clothes; I\nobeyed you every time, in everything.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t understand why you haven\u2019t\nobeyed on this occasion,\u2019 said the captain, getting\nquickly to his feet and pulling him a little way through\nthe grass, and it was so endlessly silent; stars seemed to\nbe hanging from the swaying panicles and smoke was\nblowing in regular puffs over the grass and the rocks,\nbut the faint splashing of someone wading along the\nbeach perforated the silence. Everything was so late,\nand so excessively late, the thought that it hadn\u2019t always\nbeen like this rose like the red star above his head, just as\nhigh and remote, and then this wound spreading over\nhis body like a carpet, covering everything, extending\ninto him, covering everything, and if wounds could talk\nthis one would have screamed out in despair: And now\nthis, now this as well, but he was so much a wound that\nhe hadn\u2019t even the strength to bite when the captain\u2019s\nhands started caressing him voluptuously.\n", "The Longing of Evening\nNo, obviously, there was no evening on the island.\nAfter the brief, green twilight, night fell like a weary\nsnake gliding down over its rock and everything\nbecame pitch black. Well, the stars could sometimes\nserve to guide anyone who really had to go for a walk,\nas they sent small, thin, fragile shafts of light falling\nalmost like puffs of breath through space; unsure of\nthemselves and seemingly unwilling to arrive at their\ndestination, they emphasized the stubborn and bitter\nstringency of the darkness in its role as night, hopeless\nnight, eternal night. For a while, you could get your\nbearings from sounds if you wished. Most iguanas had\nretired for the night, of course, and soon they could no\nlonger be heard rasping their way through the rocks\nwith their hard skins, but there must be some special\nstrain of iguana here that felt most at home in the dark;\nno one knew what they looked like as none of them had\never come near the fire or even come down from their\nrocks. Nevertheless, as long as it was dark, from time to\ntime you could hear loud and clear the hard slapping of\ntails, quick shuffles over stones and a strange jabbering\nsound like that made by birds, something you never\n154\n", "heard by day; but the slapping was harder, the shuffling\nquicker, as if they were bigger, more ruthless and less\nindolent animals that had now come to life; or could it\nbe that the uncertainties of night encouraged the ears of\nthe castaways to magnify all noises, make everything\nmore scary, stir up eddies of hidden desires and appa-\nrently dead fears in which the ego could rotate like an\nabandoned snail shell?\n\n\u201cOh, my God, I\u2019m so scared,\u2019 said the English girl,\n\u2018you must understand how scared I am of night. Jimmie,\nsurely you can understand that it shouldn\u2019t be like this,\nwhy couldn\u2019t everything be quite different? You must\nrealize how scared I am of everything that happens\nhere, and what has happened, and what is soon going to\nhappen. I'd thought I could help you, you must know\nyourself how unhappy you looked when we first met.\nI'd really have liked to \u2014- no I wouldn\u2019t, because I was\nshy, and frightened as well, really frightened. I knew\nstraight away who you were, and I couldn\u2019t very well\nhave known how dangerous it was to know and let\nother people know, I mean, I thought the whole time all\nthe others knew as well and I just assumed it was all an\ninnocent masquerade that could end at any minute.\nObviously I got frightened and sorry and worried when\nI saw how you looked when I gave away your secret. It\nwas just that I wanted to talk to you, but you must\nsurely realize that when I knew who you were and had\nsort of known you such a long time, it would have been\nso awfully difficult to talk to you if 1 couldn\u2019t talk to you\nand laugh with you in your real identity rather than the\none they had down on the passenger list.\n\n*You think I\u2019m silly, sitting here telling you all this\nwhen it\u2019s dark and we're as shipwrecked as it\u2019s possible\ntobe and scared of the dark and hunger and iguanas and\n", "all the rest of it. I can see you think I\u2019m extremely silly\nand I can understand I'll never get you to pull down the\ncanvas from over your head as long as I\u2019m sitting here.\nYou're probably thinking she does go on and on, this\nyoung idiot who\u2019s been chasing me all the voyage and\nstill can\u2019t leave me in peace even now when every-\nthing\u2019s gone wrong, I can hear you're saying that by\nyour silence and the way you're not moving a muscle,\nbut here I am still sitting here prattling. Oh yes, you\u2019re\ngoing to hear all sorts of things this evening, even if you\nare lying under your canvas with your fingers in your\nears and think you can shut me out. You'll see that you\ncan\u2019t in the long run and then you'll fold back the canvas\nand start talking to me about all the things that have\nbeen happening to the two of us and how important it\nall is, even though it does all seem so hopeless just now.\nBut first we've got to agree about one thing, and that\u2019s\nthat it\u2019s evening now; come on, tell me if you agree with\nme that it\u2019s evening now, and that it won\u2019t be night fora\nlittle while yet. You see, I think night is so horrible, it\ngets so dark and all sounds get so awfully loud and |\ndon\u2019t want to have to beg you to help me endure it, cos\nI know you want to be left in peace, really I do, and you\nthink what I\u2019m saying and what I\u2019m frightened of is just\nchildish nonsense that doesn\u2019t affect you in the slightest,\nbut because it means so much to me that it\u2019s evening\nnow | only hope you'll help me to believe that it really is\nevening.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t need to roll your canvas down and answer\nme, I'll be able to tell whether you want to help me or\nnot even so, not that there\u2019s all that much I want helping\nwith: just that you can make me believe there really is a\nperiod of evening before it gets night, and that you'll\nlisten to me until the evening has passed and it\u2019s time for\n\n156\n", "me to go to sleep as well. You don\u2019t want to look, and I\ncan understand that I think, you think we're all awful\nbecause we can... no, I mustn\u2019t remind you of what\u2019s\ncausing you so much trouble. I thought it was unfair, so\ncruel and horrible of you to send me away, and I didn\u2019t\nunderstand you at first. All I could understand was my\ndesire to get even with you, my own anger and my own\nsorrow; I thought you were making fun of me behind\nmy back the moment I\u2019d left you, and what I really\nwanted to do was to throw myself. . . no, no, listen, I\nwouldn\u2019t have done that in fact. You see I\u2019d had to learn\nright from the start never to show what I was thinking,\nnot to show what I was feeling, and Daddy always said\nthat was what you should be like, that\u2019s the way the\nworld is, and so you have to behave like that if you want\npeople to respect you. Poor Daddy, you\u2019d never believe\nhow much he suffered if people didn\u2019t respect him. All\nthe others in the regiment had at least somebody who\nliked them, who'd embrace them and pat them on the\nback when they met; but Daddy always surrounded\nhimself with a sort of glass cage that kept everybody at\narm\u2019s length.\n\n\u2018Oh, if only he\u2019d dared to show just what he was\nthinking and what he was feeling, just occasionally,\nthen everything might have been different; but he was\nalways so sure and so blind about all that business that\nit\u2019d never have occurred to him to change his mind. And\nif only I\u2019d been able to tell him what was wrong even so,\n\u2018cos I soon caught on, caught on to the fact that if you go\naround like that and never let anybody know what\nyou're feeling or thinking, well, in the end you just can\u2019t\nfeel or think any more. You sort of freeze over, you see,\nand before long there\u2019s simply nobody anywhere\naround you who\u2019s warm enough or even sufficiently\n", "interested in your frigidity to thaw you out. That\u2019s\nwhat was happening to me as well, but then something\nhappened, or various things, well, really it was a series\nof evenings that were nights for years on end that saved\nme. Oh, I know you think that what I\u2019m trying to tell\nyou is a bit ridiculous \u2018cos for someone like you who\u2019s\nseen so much, I mean had so many really vivid\nexperiences, well, what happens to me must seem\nincredibly uninteresting and insignificant and dull. But\nI\u2019m going to tell you all about it even so, I feel as if I\nwere full of steam and I\u2019m going to burst any minute if I\ndon\u2019t. Are you listening or have you got your fingers in\nyour ears? Never mind, you see, nothing can stop me as\nlong as the evening lasts.\u2019\n\nThe English girl paused for a moment and stretched\nout in the warm sand listening to the water caressing the\nbeach and everything else was quiet apart from the\nmuttering from the fire and as if she wanted to open\nherself up to the fire and the water and the evening, she\nflung aside the heavy cloth she had round her and lay\nnaked and thoughtful in the warm darkness. With her\nhands that were still soft, she fondled her tightly\nstretched skin, stretched more tightly than ever around\nher hips and her forehead and her knees and the ice that\nhad lain hidden in the horizon of her body melted\nrapidly. Oh, your hands, she whispered, your hands at\nlast, keep on caressing me all evening.\n\nThen she heard footsteps on the cliff, someone was\nhurrying down and stopped abruptly on meeting some-\none else.\n\n\u2018This can\u2019t go on,\u2019 she heard someone say, as if from\nthe depths of a well, \u2018it can\u2019t go on like this any longer,\nwe've got to do something. We've either got to get rid\nof him, that\u2019d be the surest and safest way. And...\u2019\n\n158\n", "But she heard no more. Either the pair of them must\nhave been whisked away into the sky, raised up like\nchimneys into the night, or she herself must have sunk\ndown into the depths with lightning speed, the voices\ngrew vague and floated like shadows through her\nconsciousness. It suddenly occurred to her there was\nsomething very urgent, there was something very\nurgent she\u2019d almost forgotten about and she came to\nwith a start, lying there in the sand and the coldness, the\ncoldest chill of all flowed into her hands and she felt as\nstiff as glass and couldn\u2019t even pull the blanket over her\nagain, over her body that felt so brutally cold. Hands,\nlong thin hands with no wrists but with thick veins\nsticking out on the underneath came creeping towards\nher over the sand, radiating cold, and crept all over her,\nslowly, slowly. They were crawling on fingers which\ndug sharp claws of ice into her flesh and she wasn\u2019t even\nshivering, for she was a block of ice herself. But all the\ntime, like a frozen lake remembering the summer\nthanks to a tiny current still flowing deep down, she\nremembered that there was something urgent, some-\nthing that had to be done before it was too late. Then\none of the hands creeping over her breast suddenly gave\nup, it couldn\u2019t go on, and the nails digging into her dug\nin even further and the hand just lay there with its spiky\nfingers sunk into her body. Deep down inside was a tiny\nmuscle, a sensitive string, and when the nail on the\nweary hand\u2019s forefinger rubbed against it, the string\nstarted singing, a sharp, high, dreadful note with sharp\nedges, and it swung around inside her like the pendulum\nof a clock gone mad. It ripped her open from within and\nblood started running through her body, all of it rushing\nto the same place, all of it rushing to the same source,\nand she grew heavy and hot just there and the pendulum\n\n159\n", "slowed down and the note sank back into its source and\nlittle bubbles rose from the bottom.\n\n\u201cEvening\u2019s over and it\u2019s getting dark,\u2019 she whispered\nor perhaps shouted. \u201cWe must hurry, I must hurry up\nand speak, you must hurry up and listen now.\u2019\n\nSome shadows flitted by, vague shadows with hard\nvoices on the waterline.\n\n\u2018This is no good,\u2019 said one of the shadows before it\ndisappeared into the darkness. \u2018Everybody must see that\nwe can\u2019t go on like this. He\u2019s been here long enough\nnow.\n\n\u2018No, we've got to do it, and preferably as soon as\npossible,\u201d yelled the other one in a hoarse voice. \u2018Not\nleast for her sake.\u2019\n\nBoth of them had disappeared as quickly as if they'd\npassed through a swing door into the darkness. Oh, she\ncouldn\u2019t afford to wait until it swung round again and\nsome stranger came towards her.\n\n\u201cNow listen to me again,\u2019 she shouted or whispered.\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s been running around shouting and quiet-\nened everything down, but now you can listen to me\nagain. You must listen because I\u2019ve been longing for you\nto do that. I\u2019ve been longing for that all my life, longing\nfor you to hear me, but up to now there\u2019s always been\nsomething getting in the way, like that mountain at\nhome when we used to shout on a summer\u2019s night and\nwait for the echo, or the croquet lawn where Daddy\nused to keep watch and make sure nobody cheated.\nWe'll have no cheating here, he used to say, banging his\nmallet against his boot, anybody who cheats at games is\na bad person, yes, a very bad person. But you should\nhave heard how he said that: I can\u2019t imitate him now,\nbut Nicky could, my only sister. She used to drag me\ninto the arbour after every game, pick up a branch and\n\n160\n", "knock it against her heel as she imitated Daddy. He'd\nretired by then, and every morning he used to go out\nand inspect the croquet lawn as if it were a battlefield,\nmeasure the distance between the hoops to see if\nanybody had moved them during the night, dry them off\nwith a rag if it had been raining, and rub them until they\nshone. He\u2019d lie down and look to make sure all the lines\nthat were supposed to be straight really were straight,\nand that no obstacles had been placed on the lawn under\ncover of darkness.\n\n* \u201cDo you think he\u2019s all there?\u2019\u2019 Nicky used to say.\nShe was two years older than me and pretty disrespectful\nalready. She disgusted me actually, and used to chew\ngum from morning till night. She liked to hop between\nthe two windows in our room, and suddenly fling\nherself on the floor and pretend our bed-ends were\ncroquet hoops.\n\n* \u201cHey, this one\u2019s out of line. Come over here and\nbring your mallet, and we'll put this right. Disgraceful,\nthis is, it\u2019s absolutely awful. How can you play an\nhonest game in these circumstances? Anybody who\ndoesn\u2019t play an honest game is a bad person.\u201d \u2019\n\n\u2018Then she used to roll under the bed we both slept in\nand pull down the red cover so that she couldn\u2019t be seen.\nShe\u2019d lie there in her red grotto, you see, and I'd have to\ngo and fetch tea and biscuits and wait outside and\npretend I was a eunuch. One day Daddy must have\nheard us \u2019cos he shouted through the window that we\nshould go out at once and play croquet, but I shouted\nback that I couldn\u2019t because I was Nicky\u2019s eunuch. I\ncould see how furious he was, and he hurled his mallet\non to the ground and more or less ran towards the house.\nThen I got scared and crawled under the bed as well and\nflung my arms around the two years that Nicky was\n\n161\n", "older than me and sobbed: \u201c\u2018I\u2019m so frightened. Daddy\u2019s\ncoming and he\u2019s going to beat me. What is a eunuch\nwhen it\u2019s at home?\u201d\n\nWe could hear his boots thundering down the\ncorridor, there were lots of big nail-heads in the floor\nand they always made a loud noise when Daddy trod on\nthem. The door was flung open and he stood for a\nmoment in silence on the threshold, breathing angrily,\nlike hounds do when they come back after a hunt. I\ncrept deeper into Nicky\u2019s two years, but there was no\nplace for my heart which kept on pounding away, and I\ngrew sweaty and sticky and in the end Nicky pushed me\naway from her. Then Daddy slammed the door behind\nhim and stood there threateningly and invisible some-\nwhere in the room. It was like when you hear a snake\nslithering through the undergrowth somewhere but you\ncan\u2019t see it. | was trembling, and Nicky did nothing to\nconsole me. Then he walked slowly over to the bed, and\nalthough he was walking so softly and slowly, the floor\nshook underneath him. Then I tried to hide in Nicky one\nlast time, I spread her long hair over my face because I\ndidn\u2019t want him to see my eyes, but she shook her head\nangrily so that her hair fell back in place, and held me\naway from her. \u2018\u2018Beware, the elephant\u2019s coming,\u201d she\nwhispered in my ear; it was all right for her, she hadn\u2019t\ndone anything after all.\n\n\u2018Then Daddy flung the cover to one side; he\u2019d known\nI was there all the time, but instead of coming straight\nup to me, he\u2019d been playing soldiers, he always played\nsoldiers: first recce, then attack. He always knew\neverything, of course, and the trouble with him was\nthat he could never pretend he didn\u2019t. I was eleven now\nand had had a difficult childhood; I thought so then and I\nstill thought so afterwards, but it does often happen that\n\n162\n", "somebody who\u2019s really had a hard time and suffered\nunjustly as a child gets so depraved by it all that when\nthe time comes to look back on it, he decides it must\nhave been a marvellous childhood if it made such a\nmarvellous man of him. That\u2019s not how it was with me,\nthough: I was very scared when I was little, and I\nremember well how the slightest little thing, in fact\nthose little things more than anything else, practically\nscared me to death sometimes.\n\n\u2018I was very frightened of little animals, you know,\nthe sort you find under stones or old croquet mallets\nthat have been left outside for weeks on end and got\nyellow grass underneath them. Big animals like eagles,\nSt Bernards or bulls, couldn\u2019t frighten me; but God; I\nwas scared stiff of little ones, | daren\u2019t go into the\nkitchen for weeks and could hardly eat anything just\nbecause a nasty little insect, no bigger than an ant, had\ncrawled out from a crack in the sink surround when I\nwent to the kitchen one night for a glass of water. It was\nquite late and all the others had gone to bed and the\nnight train was going past outside, and just as I was\ngoing to turn the tap on, this horrible little insect came\ncreeping out from under the copper surround and under\nthe chopping board. I was so frightened, so awfully\nfrightened, I thought I would faint and I ran out in panic\nand then stiffened up out of the same panic, jelly at first,\nthen something much harder and firm. I imagined in\nhorror what terrible things might happen if I so much as\nbrushed against the chopping board with my fingernail,\nand though I knew how stupid and idiotic it was to think\nlike that, I got it into my head that the creepy-crawly\nwas breeding thousands and thousands more under the\nchopping board and before long, it would be lifted up on\ntheir grey backs, and in an endless procession they\u2019d\n\n163\n", "march over to the edge of the work surface, using the\nchopping board as a bridge to cross over on to the statue\nof me standing stock-still on the kitchen floor and then\ncrawl in under my pyjamas and cover the whole of my\nbody with their stinking bodies (they had to stink as\nwell!) and in the end I'd suffocate and die with none of\nDaddy\u2019s dignity.\n\n\u2018I realized in the end the thing to do was to keep\nstaring hard at the chopping board to make sure nothing\nof the sort happened, and I fixed my gaze so firmly on\nthat chopping board covered in bits of onion that my\neyes started burning and I had to close them just for a\nsecond and as soon as I blinked I was aware of how\nawful the consequences of my slip-up would be.\n\n\u201cWell, I thought I was going to die. I didn\u2019t dare look\nany more, but I thought I could hear the chopping board\nbeing slowly lifted up and starting to move. I was\nbeyond help now, I could feel it, beyond help \u2014 and I\nscreamed. Daddy came rushing down the corridor, he\nmust have been sitting up reading his usual topo-\ngraphical handbook \u2019cos his boots clanked on the nail\nheads as usual.\n\n* \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d he shouted; not: What have\nyou done, what\u2019s the matter, have you hurt yourself?\nIf you screamed, you must want something, he couldn\u2019t\nimagine any other possible reason.\n\n\u201c\u201cTt\u2019s the animal, Daddy,\u201d\u2019 I yelled, \u201cthe animal\nunder the chopping board.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018I wanted to hug him and get support and warmth,\nbut he drew back, lifted up the chopping board and\nsquashed the little beetle against the work surface. Then\nI thought I was going to die, I thought I was going to\nthrow up all my insides, \u2018cos he picked up the yucky\nremains between his finger and thumb and held it up so\n\n164\n", "close to my face I thought I could smell its acrid fumes\nprickling in my nose.\n\n* \u201cYou mean this?\u201d he inquired contemptuously: he\nwas always contemptuous with subordinates when he\nwasn\u2019t giving them orders.\n\n\u201cYou should have seen me running through that silent\nhouse, chased by horrible tentacles, acrid smells, sticky\nsignals from little insects, the kind that always huddle\nunder small, flat stones, in the joints of old chairs that\nhave been standing out in the rain, in the seams of old\nmilitary overcoats, in the window-frames in the\nsummer-house, in the holes where the croquet hoops\nhave been taken away as autumn sets in, in tennis\nracquets that have been up in the attic for the winter, in\nyour handkerchief when you just put it down for a\nmoment on a bathing beach, in old newspapers that\nhaven\u2019t been thrown away yet, under the thwarts of\nleaky rowing boats, in the cracked putty in old windows\n\u2014 all of them just waiting for some human to display a\nmoment of weakness, just one second when they all shut\ntheir eyes, so that they can swarm out in their millions\nand spread out all over the world suffocating all other\nsigns of life.\n\n\u2018It was horrible, and in fact those little insects were\nthe only thing that beat me when Daddy came and lifted\nme out from under the bed and sat me down with a\nthump and shouted: What did you say you were\nplaying? Eunuchs, Daddy, I said, | was Nicky\u2019s eunuch.\nThen do you know, he took two big paces backwards, as\nif he were going to take a measurement, and gave me a\nseries of quick looks like electric shocks.\n\n* \u201cJust you say that word one more time,\u201d he said\nthreateningly. And I said \u201ceunuch\u201d one more time\nbecause I wanted to know what it meant.\n\n165\n", "\u2018Then he gave me such a thwack on my cheek that I\u2019d\nhave fallen over if the bed hadn\u2019t been in the way.\n\n\u2018*\u2018Just you say it one more time,\u201d he said triumph-\nantly, not believing I would ever dare to do so.\n\n**\u201cEunuch, Daddy,\u201d I said. I still had no idea what\nwas going on.\n\n\u201cThen he thwacked me on my other cheek so hard the\nbed disappeared in a shower of stars and I fell over. AsI\nlay there, trying to find my way back into the room, I\nheard him shouting in the far distance, \u201c\u201cCome on out,\nNicky. Did you teach Draga that word?\u201d\n\n*\u201c\u201cNo, Daddy,\u201d\u2019 I heard her saying from the roof of a\nwell, so cheeky and wide-eyed you'd have to be a\nsoldier not to realize she was lying. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard\nthat word before.\u201d\n\n\u2018Then he shouted for Mrs Muehlhouse, and she came\nrushing in and picked me up, breathing onions all over\nme, and dragged me off to the bathroom.\n\n\u2018Daddy had said I should be shut up in disgrace until I\nsaid I was sorry. She put me down on the floor, put the\nlight on and locked the door as quickly as she could, so\nthat I couldn\u2019t get a look into her eyes and see that she\nwas really ashamed of herself. There I was, you see,\nthinking I wanted to stay in that bathroom for ever and\never and never come out, never ever, because every-\nthing was so unfair. I found a comb and combed my long\nhair over my face, so hard and wild and defiant I dared\nnot even look at it in the mirror. I made a couple of little\ncracks so I could see through, and hoped I would look\nlike Clara Bow when I grew up.\n\n\u201cBut that was when I remembered the little insects\nthat lived in the bathroom wall. Milli always used to\nshow me them when she bathed me. What a life, she\n\n166\n", "would say, what a miserable existence. They were\nlittle, hunched-up grey insects that could fly a couple of\ninches at a time when you touched them with your\nfinger, but generally they just sat there on the wall like\nlittle bits of hardened dirt. I just can\u2019t tell you how\nhorrible it was when they tried to fly. There are kinds of\nbutterfly that look so like rats when they spread their\nwings out that you have to keep thinking: butterfly,\nbutterfly, in order not to feel sick; and there are all\nkinds of insects that move through the air with a sort of\nmechanical jerkiness you just can\u2019t imagine is natural;\nbut there isn\u2019t a single bird or insect or beetle that flew\nin as horrible a way as these did, \u2018cos you could see all\nthe time they were creeping really, that somehow or\nother they\u2019d been given a pair of dirty little wings by\nmistake, and they could use them to help them up or\ndown a wall, but not in the air, not when it came to\nflying.\n\n\u2018I sat down on the edge of the bath, and all of a\nsudden, are you with me, everything started spinning\nround, and I could feel the walls slowly creeping in on\nme, just as slowly as Daddy had walked when he\napproached the bed a few minutes previously. They\ngave off a piercing, painful smell, and although I didn\u2019t\ndare look at them for fear of falling, I knew they'd\nchanged colour, they weren\u2019t green any longer, they\nwere grey, grey because they were covered all over\nfrom floor to ceiling in a layer of these little flying\ninsects. The room was getting smaller and smaller, and\nwhen a few drops of water dropped from the ceiling and\ninto my hair, I thought I was finished and I started\nscreaming, I just screamed and screamed until the boots\nstarted clumping up the staircase.\n\n\"*What do you want?\u201d shouted Daddy through the\n\n167\n", "locked door. \u201cAre you going to say you're sorry at long\nlast?\u201d\n\n\u2018I'd do anything to get out of this prison, no price was\ntoo high to pay.\n\n\u201c\u201cYes,\u201d I yelled, so scared I thought I was going to\ndie, \u2018Oh, yes, Daddy, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m sorry Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u2018There was only an inch left before I suffocated to\ndeath, so there were still sacrifices to be made.\n\n\u2018\u201cPromise me you'll never say that word again!\u201d\n\n*\u201cYes, Daddy,\u201d\u2019 I shouted. \u201cNever, never again.\u201d I\ncouldn\u2019t even remember what word he was talking\nabout.\n\n\u201cThen I was lying under the bed in mine and Nicky\u2019s\nroom, without crying, as cold and lifeless as a log\nfloating in a lake. All I had strength to do was to give\nNicky a kick, the little hypocrite, when she came to\nconsole me.\n\n*\u201c\u201cAnd he\u2019s supposed to be a soldier,\u201d\u2019 she said scorn-\nfully. She\u2019d heard Uncle Bennie (Mummy\u2019s brother,\nwho did exist once upon a time, but now he only\nemerged as God and King) use words like that about\nDaddy when he was reprimanded for borrowing too\nmuch money from the gardener in order to go gambling;\nand she pinched my bottom gently but I just kicked at\nher till she went away giggling. I just lay there, you\nknow, like I\u2019m lying here now with you, on my back,\nmy heels pressed down on to the ground with my toes\npointing straight up, and my hands pressed so tightly\nagainst my breasts they must have left a red mark\nafterwards, and I was staring up at the stars, I was\npretending the bottom of the bed was the sky you see,\nand nothing hurt any more, and nothing felt nice either,\nbut down inside me was a scream that was still hidden\nlike an unknown fish under the mud at the bottom of a\n\n168\n", "little lake, but then: look how it\u2019s working away,\ndigging with its nose, slowly forcing its way up through\nthe green light at the bottom, then it swishes its tail and\nshoots up to the surface, and eeeeh. . . and I screamed\nunder the bed and nobody heard me even so, everybody\nwas down on the croquet lawn, and only seconds earlier\nI'd heard the regular, dull thuds of the mallets, maybe\nsomebody was standing in front of one of the hoops,\nleaning on his mallet: Did you hear that fox yelping\nover there in the park? Nobody heard me, and you could\nsay: Who would understand why I screamed? That I\nscreamed because nobody came to keep me warm,\nnobody came and unbuttoned his coat and let my head\nnestle up against his chest, nobody came and bent over\nme so that I could stroke his head and caress it, nobody\ncame and saw that I could feel cold even though it\nwas so warm inside the house and so warm outside as\nwell during the day. They just laughed away on the\ncroquet lawn, in a dignified manner, of course, maybe\nthey were laughing at one of Daddy\u2019s jokes which\nalways ended up with a command: Laugh now, one,\ntwo, three.\n\n\u2018I sneaked up to the window and saw the newly\nvarnished croquet balls gleaming in the wet grass, and\nthe six players - Daddy, Nicky, Mrs Muehlhouse,\nUncle Richard the old major and his two grown-up\ndaughters, known to Nicky as the Giraffes - wending\ntheir way among the hoops like partners in some\ncomplicated formation dance. Daddy was at their head,\nand he kept turning round with a stern expression on his\nface, checking on how they were behaving and barking\nout advice they all pretended to follow with a smile,\nwhile their hands were in fact trembling with sup-\npressed irritation. Kate, my giggling grown-up cousin\n\n169\n", "who had to bend down in order to pat me on the head,\nhad forgotten to fasten the belt of her pink dress, and it\nhung down behind her like a tail, switching and\nswinging in ridiculous fashion every time she hit a ball.\n\n\u201cOh, I was so high up and could see everything and\neverything was so silly that I burst out laughing and\nthen I suddenly started crying because I thought they'd\nlocked me up in the house and I felt so cooped up inside\nmyself and so much excluded from everybody\u2019s heart\nthat I wriggled over the floor like a worm, back under\nthe bed, and stayed there until it was evening and Mrs\nMuehlhouse picked me up and examined me under the\nlight as if I'd been ill in some awful and mysterious way.\n\n\u201cOh, many times over the years I would lie there all\nalone under the bed, waiting for someone to come and\npick me up and put me down carefully as if I\u2019d been\nsome nasty little animal that made their hands dirty as\nlong as they were in contact with it. She\u2019s stubborn, this\nlittle girl, people would say as they passed through the\nrooms, damned stubborn she is. And they were right: I\nwas stubborn; I\u2019d built up a saga all around me that I\ncould creep into every night and I could defy the whole\nworld from there. It was a saga about evening, about\nthe longing of evening, and it was a long and stubborn\nsaga. I would creep into it as if it were an incredibly big,\nblue shell, and right up at the top was a big, warm star.\nAnd every night Daddy would stand in the doorway of\nmine and Nicky\u2019s room and say in that metallic voice of\nhis: Time to go to sleep now, girls, it\u2019s night now; and I\nwould pull my shell over me and the most marvellous\nthings would happen.\n\nSometimes, just imagine, the red star would come\nloose and fall slowly down towards me, and sometimes\nit would turn into a stallion\u2019s eye, and the horse would\n", "start growing from it, with its neck and mane and\nhooves and lovely big tongue that it used to lick me\nwith, all over my body as I lay naked so that it wouldn\u2019t\nwet my pyjamas; but other times the evening star was a\nlamp on the top floor of a tall building, and the man said\nHurry up as he helped me over the blue street full of red\nbuses and flowering plants, hurry on up while your\nMummy is still alive. And so I\u2019d run like mad and I could\nhear a loud screeching noise behind me and I realized\nhe'd been run over by one of the buses, but I hadn\u2019t time\nto turn round \u2018cos the lift was just leaving. We flew up\npast all the storeys, and one after another the passengers\nwould disappear through a hole in the floor, leaving\nbehind big white rings of saliva that I\u2019d try and keep\nclear of in my horror. But the lift just kept on rising,\nfaster and faster, and it started rocking like a rowing\nboat and suddenly I saw somebody trying to force his\nway up through the hole, several long fingers were\ncrawling in through the crack in the floor and at first I\nthought they were snakes and so I ran at them and\njumped on them, only then they started squealing and\nwhen I looked down I could see they were fingers in fact\nand the littled screams were coming out from under\ntheir nails. Then they disappeared all of a sudden, and\nwhen I opened the lid over the hole I could see Daddy\nfalling down the lift shaft, but slowly, very slowly and\ngently like they do in slow-motion films, and it all\nlooked so ridiculous I started laughing so much I nearly\nfell out through the hole.\n\n\u201cDaddy\u2019s face was bright red, he was so furious, and\nhe was trying in vain to fall a bit faster so he could catch\nup with his boots that were falling about three feet\nbelow him, but it was no good and the boots just\nwiggled annoyingly backwards and forwards. I must\n\n171\n", "have done a good job on his fingers, though, \u2019cos they'd\nbroken off his hand and were falling in a bunch a couple\nof feet above Daddy\u2019s head, and the area between his\nhead and the fingers was full of wobbly spots of blood.\n\u2018Then all at once the speed of fall increased, not\ngradually, but with horrific suddenness and I\u2019m con-\nvinced the fingers and the blood caught up with Daddy\nbefore the drum roll sounded, that drum roll they\nalways have just before a trapeze artist launches himself\ninto space. Anyway, the lift stopped now and I didn\u2019t\nstop to listen to the crash, but leapt over the nasty saliva\nand found myself in the blue room, as high as a church\nnave, bathed in the blue light of evening. Draga, my\nown little girl, come on through to me, shouted Mummy\nfrom the next room, and I popped through an oval in the\nwall into this equally big, blue room, but there was\nnobody there, and I had to pass through a never-ending\nseries of blue rooms, and Mummy\u2019s voice got louder and\nlouder, and suddenly there I was in the hall I\u2019d seen from\nthe road outside. It was also empty, but I could still hear\nthe echo of Mummy\u2019s voice, and in the big Gothic\nwindow was a lamp with my red star in it, and then the\nlamp called to me: Draga, I\u2019m your mother, said the\nlamp, and the pink shade fluttered and suddenly I felt so\ncold I started shivering and I ripped open my dress and\nclutched the burning lamp tightly against my breast.\n\u2018Then it started growing and it became heavy and\nwarm and we fell over together and lay on the floor and\nthe lamp was still growing, and it grew arms and legs\nand wrapped itself round me and it was so warm and\nnice and my eyelids were so heavy I just couldn\u2019t see\nanything. But then the star fell out of the lamp and it slid\nover my breast, oh so lovely and warm, and down\ntowards my stomach and then back again. Then all of a\n", "sudden, I seemed to have swallowed it, I could feel it\nfloating through my guts like a red-hot bullet, through\nmy stomach, and finally it came to rest between my legs\nand the light from it must have been so strong it shone\nout from the whole of my body when I got to my feet,\nbut then the lamp had gone and I felt very strong and\nalmost weightless, and the light followed me wherever\nI went.\n\n\u2018I went over and lit up a solitary organ made of\ndark-stained wood right at the back of the room, sat\ndown on the stool and played a pretty little tune that\nrose up like smoke into the blue evening, but I had to\nstop because the music was making me cry so much.\nThen Mummy said from inside me: Draga, my own\nlittle girl, now I\u2019m inside you; and I replied: Yes,\nMummy, now you're with me, and I felt so warm all\nover, but warmest of all between my legs where the star\nstill was.\n\n\u2018Then I suddenly thought about Daddy and I said:\nMummy, I feel so sorry. I threw Daddy down the lift\nshaft. That\u2019s nothing to be sorry about, replied Mummy,\nhe\u2019s up here as well. And she directed my gaze at a\nwindow, and there was a statue of Daddy just on the\npoint of jumping out with his boots and his sword-belt\nand a croquet mallet in one hand. Mummy, I said, can I\npush Daddy down into the street? Yes, my child, said\nMummy, that won\u2019t matter, there are so many of him.\n\n\u2018Then I ran over to the window and opened it and I\ncould see some children down below stop with their\nfruit baskets in their hands and point up at me, I expect\nthey thought it was a bid odd to see a luminous girl.\nThen I gave the statue a hefty shove and it started falling,\nand first it fell about halfway down like a statue, but\nthen it suddenly came alive and started waving its arms\n", "about, and when it hit the roof of the bus it seemed to\nhave turned back into a statue again. The red bus didn\u2019t\nstop as I'd expected it to do, but it just carried on calmly\nto the crossroads. When the crowds had dispersed, it\nlooked as if someone had been having fun smashing\nflowerpots underneath my window, and a few men in\nbowler hats were waving excitedly on the pavement\nbeside the pile of bits, and I realized it must be all that\nwas left of Daddy. Then one of the gentlemen waved\ndown a concrete lorry, one of those with a container\nspinning round and round on top of it, and the driver\njumped out and all four of them helped to throw the bits\nin through a gap in the mixer. The lorry set off again\nand one of the men in a bowler jumped up on the\nrunning board and waved like mad with a red hand-\nkerchief, shouting to everybody to get out of the way,\nand with its horn sounding non-stop and the man in the\nbowler hat clinging to the side like a miniature devil,\nthe lorry disappeared from view. Then the star started\nburning and I grew warm and heavy and fell over on to\nthe floor and I was so happy at the thought that I need\nnever get up again. We lay there, Mummy and I, as if\nwe were on the bottom of a little blue sea, and I\nwhispered: Mummy, you'll stay with me now, won't\nyou? You'll stay for a really long time, won\u2019t you? Oh\nyes, said Mummy, all evening. I'll stay all evening.\n\u201cAnd the evenings got longer and longer, and\nsometimes I couldn\u2019t get to sleep until dawn. My dear\nchild, Mrs Muehlhouse said, and I gave a start because\nno one but Mummy had the right to call me \u201cMy dear\nchild\u2019\u2019. But the people sitting in the lounge or walking\nthrough the rooms always said: She\u2019s stubborn, that one\nis, and they were right: I noticed how my shell was\ngetting harder and harder for every evening that passed,\n174\n", "while deep down I was getting softer and softer, and I\ncould see I had to have a hard shell as my inside was so\nterribly soft, but nobody else could see that and that was\nwhy I was so keen to keep everything that might\npossibly scratch it, knock it or stroke it with rough\nhands at a distance. With well-bred nonchalance |\naccepted everybody\u2019s advice, took part in all the games\npeople forced on to me, and behaved impeccably on the\ncroquet lawn where on one occasion the jolly little\ngeneral\u2019s wife nearly made Daddy burst with anger\nwhen she actually kicked her ball through the double\nhoop, and when he told her off she just laughed and\nwaved her mallet in his face so that he just had to smile\nin order to be polite, although his lips were tightly set\nand his ears red with fury; but later that evening I heard\nwhispering coming from the arbour: My little buffalo,\nmy little buffalo, and I was possessed by a curious\nindifference and peered between the branches, and saw\nher lying full length on the wooden bench with her head\non Daddy\u2019s knee, playing with his free hand.\n\n\u201cThat evening I jumped straight out of the lift and ran\nthrough all the blue rooms and with an urgency which\nstartled me hurled the statue of Daddy down from the\nmantelpiece. And do you know what I did next?\nMummy, I shouted in triumph when [ heard the crash in\nthe street down below, now you can...\n\n\u2018Not yet,\u2019 the English girl went on, worried, \u2018not yet,\ndo you hear me, it\u2019s still evening you see,\u2019 but someone\nwas standing in the darkness behind her, tapping\nsomething hard with his knuckles. Silently, she rolled a\nlittle closer to the boxer before whispering bitterly,\n\u201cNow listen to me, Jimmie, I\u2019m the one you should listen\nto and as long as you do it\u2019s still evening.\u2019\n\nBut whoever it was standing in the darkness behind\n\n175\n", "her sat down in the sand now, still tapping away, and\nshe could hear the others creeping up, slowly, slowly\nthrough the grating sand.\n\n\u201cThen there was a time when the star got smaller and\nsmaller, it lost some of its heat, and it wasn\u2019t as bright as\nit used to be, either. When Daddy turned the light out, I\nused to burrow down into the pillow in desperation, and\ntry to pull the shell over my head; but I felt so hollow\nand washed out, I just couldn\u2019t keep up any more.\nSometimes my tall cousin, one of the Giraffes, used to\ncome out by car from town to pay us a visit, with her\nbig, green parasol and her daughter Vivian. When\nVivian and I were alone in the garden, | used to pick her\nup and whisper in her stupid ear: It\u2019s your mummy,\nVivian, it\u2019s Mummy, and when we were alone in the\nlounge I used to lay her down beside me on the sofa and\nunbutton my dress and try and pull her head to my\nbreast, but she used to kick and bite and my cousin\nwould come running from wherever she was in the\nhouse. Mummy, Draga isn\u2019t my mummy, is she? the\nsilly thing would shout, and one evening I was listening\noutside a half-open door and heard the Giraffe say: I\ndon\u2019t like the way Draga plays around with Vivian, it\nseems really perverse.\n\n\u2018Later on, when we were sitting round the tea-table\nin the drawing room and I was as stiff and cold as if\nsomeone had driven a frosty pole right through me, I\nsuddenly broke right through all the conversation with\nmy enormous chilliness. Daddy, I said, Daddy, what\ndoes \u201cperverse\u201d mean? Straight away, he turned just as\nred as I thought he would and bit through a sugar lump\nin frustration, while his hand just chewed and chewed\naway at the edge of the table; but Uncle Bennie, who'd\nlost twenty pounds on the horses that day, explained to\n\n176\n", "me as loudly as he could. Now I\u2019m going to give you a\nreally good hiding, said Daddy that evening when we\nwere on our own, and he did, and then the evenings\nstarted coming back again.\n\n\u201cFor a while, Nicky was out nearly every night, and if\nanyone asked where she was, I had to say something or\nother she'd told me to, I\u2019ve forgotten what it was. I\nhated her, because I had a vague idea as to why she used\nto be so flushed when she crept into our room in the\nmornings, and I loathed the way she would lie and tell\nme she'd been running the last bit in order to get back\nhome in time - when it was five o\u2019clock in the morning.\nBut one evening I sneaked out myself and stood\ntrembling on the steps, but no one had heard me, and on\nthe road near the dead oak tree was the young man\nwaiting for me; he\u2019d asked Nicky to tell me he\u2019d be\nthere waiting for me by the old oak tree at ten o'clock\nevery night for a week, and if I didn\u2019t come out and\nmeet him one of those nights, a leaky rowing boat with\nhim in it would sink in the middle of the lake and we'd\nbe fishing him out on our stretch of shore a couple of\nweeks later. I went to the old oak tree just because I\nwanted to be polite, I went because I didn\u2019t want a\npotential suicide to do anything rash, and when I came\nup to him I said: Well what do you want?\n\n\u2018Then he grabbed me hard by the arm and marched\nme backwards and forwards in the woods for a whole\nhour, and I was freezing cold as I only had a thin dress\non, I\u2019d intended going straight back in again you see,\nand the dew started settling on us and all you could hear\nwas a cuckoo saying something or other on the other\nside of the lake, but I'd had my evening ruined and\nwanted to yell out in protest, but every time we turned,\nhis grip tightened and I realized it was a clenched\n\n177\n", "tongue that was being punished. Then he suddenly burst\nout: Are you cold? and when I said I was he seemed to\nthink he\u2019d conquered me at last and dragged me half-\nrunning through the woods.\n\n\u2018I could see the sky all white through the trees and I\nwas horrified at the thought of it being so late, but as we\ncame to the edge of the trees I could see a big tent ina\nlittle clearing. 1 thought at first it was a circus, but I\ncould tell from the stale smell that hit you as you went\nin, and the long, silent pews and the ugly little altar on\nthe podium that it was some kind of evangelical church\nmarquee, abandoned by both God and man. A stove was\ncrackling away on the podium not far from the altar,\nand we walked hand in hand down the aisle towards it.\nAre you still cold? he asked when we\u2019d come up on to\nthe podium and found ourselves at a complete dead end.\nNo, I said, and he thought I was giving in and he put his\narms on my shoulders like a dog and we fell down\ntogether.\n\n\u2018L lay still on my back and could feel the heat from the\nstove creeping all over me, and the roof of the tent was\nrippling like the surface of a lake, and then all of a\nsudden I seemed to realize what he intended to do to me,\nand it was all so horrible I wanted to throw up, and I\nraised myself on to one elbow and started kicking him\ntill he yelled out in pain.\n\n* \u201cThat\u2019s not what I want,\u2019 I screamed, and it seemed\nas if somebody else had put those words into my\ninexperienced lips, \u2018that\u2019s not what I want.\u201d\n\n* \u201cWhat do you want, then?\u201d he spat out scornfully as\nhe staggered back towards the stove.\n\n*\u201cT just want to be warm,\u201d\u2019 I said, \u2018I want to get\nreally warm, and I\u2019ve gota star there that\u2019d burn you if\nyou tried.\u201d\u201d\n\n178\n", "\u201cThen he started banging the stove doors and smoke\nbillowed out and started us off coughing. He tried to\nkeep me there by pretending to be suffering badly and\nspluttering and moaning away, but I ran through the\nchurch as fast as I could and managed to duck and avoid\nthe lump of firewood that knocked a chip out of one of\nthe pews instead.\n\n\u2018It was only when I\u2019d got home and snuggled down\nunder the covers I realized not how scared I was, but\nhow much it had all hurt. I started crying, but not in the\nusual convulsive way at all, the tears just flowed out as\neasily as if there was somebody else crying inside me,\nand it was just as incredibly easy to scream afterwards: I\njust opened my mouth and Mummy or whoever it was\ndid all the screaming inside me.\n\n\u201cOne evening Mrs Muehlhouse forced me to go with\nher to the tent church for a service, and among the\npeople gathered around the entrance was a tall, grey-\nhaired man with drooping eyelids, with his arm round a\nyouth of about my age. The pastor and his son,\nwhispered Mrs Muehlhouse respectfully, and then I\nrecognized him, then I recognized the boy: it was the\none who'd threatened to drown himself on my account,\nthe one who'd flung me on to the floor between the\naltar and the stove.\n\n\u2018Later on, when we were sitting there and I was\nfeeling numb because of all the bodies giving witness\nand overflowing with worship and warmth, somebody,\nI can\u2019t remember who, but somebody went up to the\npodium with me and I found myself standing there\nsinging, singing all on my own some song or other I\ndidn\u2019t know in a voice I didn\u2019t recognize. The pastor\nand his family were sitting on a little bench right at the\nfront, and while I was singing I heard the pastor\u2019s fat\n\n179\n", "wife say: Somebody should shut her up, somebody\nought to shut her up, but the pastor said: Why, it\u2019s\nlovely.\n\n\u2018Then the song was finished, but I didn\u2019t realize that\nuntil there was a long silence afterwards and it was Mrs\nMuehlhouse with her white face and her raised eye-\nbrows who made me come to. Then I went down on my\nknees at the side of the altar and the rich, mellifluous\nvoice inside me said: Sinner, sinner, sinner . . . who\u2019s\nsitting on the bench with the white chip in it, who\nthrew a lump of firewood at me when everything had\ngone wrong for him?\n\n*\u201cThere,\u201d\u2019 | whispered, pointing at the pew where\nthe pastor and his family were sitting. \u2018\u201cThere, just look\nat him blushing and turning pale, first one then the\nother, and see how he\u2019d love to run out of the tent in\nshame and fear, look at him, all you who have lifted up\nyour hearts, look at the pastor\u2019s son: he\u2019s the one who\nthrew me down one night between the altar and the\nstove, and tried to rape me.\u201d\u201d\n\n\u201cSuddenly, there was nothing but silence, the kind of\nsilence you get between lightning and thunder, and\nonce again I was raised up to the cruel surface of reality\nand I looked at the pastor\u2019s son who had turned as pale as\na sheet \u2014 and something horrible must have happened: I\ndidn\u2019t recognize him at all, there wasn\u2019t the slightest\nsimilarity between him and the boy who claimed he\nwanted me, oh, it was all so awful, and when I suddenly\nsaw Mrs Muehlhouse\u2019s red face below me, all swollen\nwith embarrassment, and with the abnormal urgency of\na suicide I just opened myself up to the scream within\nme, I gave myself up like a beast on heat to the scream\nwithin me, I dissolved myself in deadly acids, I dived\nstraight down with wide-open eyes into the octopus and\n\n180\n", "was pulled to the floor on the podium, as the scream was\nso heavy I just couldn\u2019t carry it in a standing position.\n\n\u201cAfterwards, they told me they\u2019d had to carry me all\nthe way home, screaming like crazy, and it must have\nbeen ages before anything happened to me apart from a\nwhite flagpole constantly being taken down and then\nraised up again in front of my eyes. When they thought I\nwas fit enough again, they sent me off on this voyage\ntogether with a stout lady who never said a word and\nwho\u2019s lying in bed ill in Ronton just now, waiting for us\nto come back; when she gets hold of your wrist, it feels\nas if you have handcuffs on.\n\n\u201cBut I was rescued from her \u2014 and Jimmie, I met you,\n[heard the captain telling somebody who you were \u2018cos\nI didn\u2019t recognize you even though I said I did to get you\non my side, I was surrounded by enemies you see,\neverybody was keeping watch on me, everybody\nexcept you. I thought: he\u2019s the one who can give you\nwarmth, he can keep evenings going on for ages, he can\ngive you back the warm body you lost and I know you'd\nlike to do that, Jimmie, I can feel it in the heat of that\nstar that\u2019s come back again, Jimmie, shall I fold back the\ncanvas and kiss your throat? You have a little red mark\njust under your adam\u2019s apple and that\u2019s where I want to\nkiss you; or shall I stroke your arms and hands and give\nyour muscles little bites, I think they'll taste like\nrhubarb; or shall I undress you and give you my warm\nstar so that it can keep both of us warm, \u2019cos I need to be\nwarm, Jimmie. I do so long for warmth and evening. I\nneed to be so warm, so warm, Jimmie.\u2019\n\nBut the drumming behind her became more and more\nunbearable, and now somebody was beating the sand\nwith a stick, hard and nastily.\n\n\u2018Leave me alone!\u2019 she cried, flinging herself backwards\n\n181\n", "in fury; but they didn\u2019t leave her alone. The four\nshadows in the sand, crouching round some invisible\ncamp fire, came closer and closer, one step at a time,\nlike pawns surrounding a king. Oh, they knew every-\nthing, they had octopus arms and eagle eyes and the\nvenom of a snake and the agility of a puma, and she was\nuseless against their combined strength and there was\nnothing she could do: just give in, once again, dive down\ninto the octopus, bare breasts for the eagle\u2019s beak, take\noff her shoes for the snake and embrace the puma \u2014 and\nthen the scream:\n\n\u201cYou think I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t you? You're probably\nthinking: there she is, the fool, prattling on and on\nwithout having the slightest idea, it\u2019s just incredible, it\u2019s\nnot normal, it\u2019s horrible; but you see, you\u2019re all wrong.\nOh yes, I know he\u2019s dead, I know he\u2019s been lying here\ndead all day, and you say: how can anybody be in love\nwith a dead man, how can anybody talk to a dead man\nlike that, how can anybody want to caress him? But\nlook: why do you think I loved him, why do you think I\ndared to love him? Because he was so strong, so healthy,\nso full of power and strength? No! No! Because he was\nill and weak, because his wounds had started stinking,\nbecause he was a cripple, because I never needed to\nthink: he\u2019ll want to have me tonight, he\u2019ll come and\nforce himself into me in his hut or in the bushes and he'll\npour out his rugged manliness all over me, he'll come\nand force my legs apart, with a plank if needs be, and\nhe\u2019ll hurt me as much as he needs to do in order to satisfy\nhis desires and his vanity, he'll slobber all over my face\nand convince himself I love him as a result, he'll shower\nme with nasty words and think they turn me on; oh no,\nhow could I love anybody I'd be afraid of getting all that\nfrom? \u2014 But a dead man, a dead body that\u2019s stopped\n\n182\n", "longing for such horrid embraces, what's purer than a\ndead man, what\u2019s more worth loving than a dead or\ndying man, because you can confess everything to a\ndead body that\u2019s still got its living consistency, and yet\nyou can still retain your innocence; is there anything\nyou can love more passionately and more painfully than\nsomeone who's just died and who can no longer lure out\nof you in all kinds of dirty ways the impure under-\ncurrents of your emotions? Oh, to be loved in return,\nthat\u2019s what I was always so afraid of, I was always\nafraid of being loved in return, | was always seeking\nwarmth, but only I could provide that in my love of the\ndefenceless, those who were not strong enough to force\ntheir own cruel, ugly love on to me. So take him away\nfrom me now, bury him, and put sand and stones over\nhim, but don\u2019t forget to do what I can see your eyes\nbrimming over with desire to do to me. Fling yourselves\non to me and force your way into me, look, I\u2019m\ndefenceless, I don\u2019t even have a star between my legs as\nI\u2019ve always boasted of having, press me down into the\nsand and let my hatred inflame you even more, really\nturn you on, so that your performance gets more and\nmore frenzied. Poor little thing who\u2019s short on love,\nyou all think, she\u2019s not worth anything better than being\nraped, than being forced into making love, in the name\nof justice, amen. Get on to her then. Roll me over - no,\nyou won\u2019t need a plank, you won't even need to use\nyour fists, I shan\u2019t defend myself, I just don\u2019t need to\ndefend myself any more, a dead woman doesn\u2019t need to\ndefend herself, a dead woman who\u2019s lost everything\nalready, or gained everything, so there.\u2019\n\nAnd the four shadows soon pounce on her, the beach\nis suddenly a very lively place, it\u2019s as if herds of all kinds\nof animals come charging out, wolves, bison, hyenas,\n\n183\n", "tigers, and all their heavy bodies make the beach shake\nand each animal that flits past her showers her with the\nacrid perfume of wolves or tigers or lions and then the\nsmoke from a stove in a white tent wrapping itself\ngently and as soft as cotton wool like bandages round\nher limbs until she almost chokes - and then those\nflagpoles, those white flagpoles, those eternal flagpoles\nbeing lowered and raised and lowered and raised witha\nfluttering pennant from a thin, thin scream.\n184\n", "The Fires of Night\nNow the fire is flickering brightly on the beach. The\ntide is sliding gently in over the sand, and the fire is\nreflected in the water. But the night has many fires. In\nVerdisse, the camp fire burned until dawn, the horses\nshivered in their nakedness, and a giant had slung a\nnecklace of fire over the plain. Then, the stallions\nsnorted loudly just before the explosion came. But the\nnight has many fires. Petrol over the bodies, frozen stiff\nand breaking like twigs, and then the fires sinking\nslowly through the ice, leaving behind eighteen graves\nin Lake Tibirsik when morning came. But the night has\nmany fires. Lying alone and freezing in the heat before\nthe open fire, where all the apples have already burnt to\na cinder, and hearing somebody coming downstairs and\na whiplash dragging along behind on the stairs like a\nrat\u2019s tail, then the pain in your back a quarter of an hour\ntoo early and then the fire flaring up in response to the\ndrama. But the night has many fires. See the fire\nsmouldering in someone\u2019s eyes, feel the heat radiating\nfrom a body that wants more fires but for its own part\nonly wants to be extinguished the whole of the long\nnight, and then extinguished more and more, all the\n185\n", "time just covered in ashes, then only ashes. But the night\nhas many fires. Lying stretched out under a canvas sheet\nand feeling how hot your fingertips become, feeling the\nheat running through your fingers and into your hands\nand into your arms and into your shoulders and down\nthrough your trunk, down through your legs, into your\nfeet, into your toes, and knowing all the time, always\nknowing above all else that the only way of getting rid\nof this pain is to cool yourself down through contact\nwith someone else\u2019s skin, someone else\u2019s body, someone\nelse\u2019s arms, hands. And fighting with yourself as with\nthe devil, fighting with your own limbs, struggling with\nyour own fingers, resisting with all your strength and\nstill not winning, because in the end you get so hot,\nyou\u2019d burn up if you didn\u2019t let your fingers have their\nown way.\n\nAnd then those hands, those hands that are always so\nhot, sneak out on to the canvas and slide over towards\nthe person sleeping by your side. He\u2019s fast asleep, the\nglow of the fire is breathing in Boy Larus\u2019s motionless\nface, his eyelids are closed yet alert, and his hand is\nclenching and unclenching on the canvas. There\u2019s a\nlittle way to go yet, the heat is getting worse and worse,\nit\u2019s as if your skin were burning but not being used up,\nand that\u2019s the worst thing of all: that you just can\u2019t burn\nup once and for all and put the whole business behind\nyou at last, and then that hand clenching for the last\ntime and slapping your wrist while that look, filled with\nthe deepest scorn imaginable, digs into your face like a\nneedle, your unprotected face. Boy Larus hasn\u2019t got up,\nhe\u2019s still lying there as usual hunched painfully in a\nposture made up of equal parts of fear and contempt,\nexactly the same as usual, but in that case how come the\ncaptain now sees him creeping towards him like a snake,\n\n186\n", "his tongue has suddenly grown longer than all the others\nand is shooting out from between his teeth lightning-\nfast, but before his feet are covered in the patterned skin\nhe gives Tom Solider a big kick, as if to wake him up, to\nwarn him of a very real danger.\n\n\u2018Oh, if only you\u2019d been on your own, you're so\ncowardly when you're alone,\u2019 whispers the captain to\nthe snake but the snake just keeps on creeping nearer\nand nearer, its head swaying slyly and wearily from side\nto side, and Boy Larus\u2019s eyes are set deep, deep down\ninside it, as motionless as glass beads.\n\n\u2018If only I\u2019d had an awl,\u2019 says the captain, \u2018a long,\ncobbler\u2019s awl, you\u2019d have been hopelessly beaten,\u2019 but\nthe snake just keeps on coming and there's nowhere to\nrun away to, there has never been anywhere to run\naway to: just wait for the whip, the strike, the bite, the\nblow - and suddenly the snake\u2019s head falls on him like an\naxe, its little scales glittering in the firelight, and the\nbite-wound, always equally horrific, must be gaping\nlike a mouth just above your knee.\n\nAllis lost, and he knows that when he starts running,\nbut he runs even so until the poison turns his knee into a\nstone which first aches and then becomes as heavy as\nlead and doesn\u2019t hurt any more. He\u2019s pulled down by it\nand lies there on his back like a beaten iguana while the\ntransformation takes possession of him and everything\nhappens as it usually does. There is a shattering kind of\nsolitude which can change the whole world into one big\nfield or rather, one flat surface; you can see everywhere\nand yet at the same time you can\u2019t possibly see\neverywhere, it\u2019s a stretch of metal gleaming like a\nball-bearing without any trace of a soft patch, not a\nsingle hollow to hide in, not a single hole to crawl down\ninto. This surface gives off a shiny, oily light but it is\n\n187\n", "also lit up by a cruelly sharp radiance from above,\ncoming from some motionless heavenly body, a huge\nsphere made of the same cool, oily metal as the one\nyou're attached to yourself, sweating this light through\nits milliards of pores. On this surface of your solitude,\nthere are no shadows either; you can\u2019t raise your hand\nor your arm for instance and try and hide behind the\nshadows they cast, the light just keeps on pouring all\nover you, and moreover, it\u2019s not possible to move\neither, you\u2019re stuck to the spot, not by some unseen rope\nor bond you can tear away or chew to pieces; the\nremarkable thing, the key to it all, perhaps you might\neven say the meaning of your situation is precisely the\nfact that you can\u2019t do anything about it, and you just lie\nthere with your back pressed against the hard surface\nlike a drawing pin sticking to a magnet, and all the time,\nlight keeps on pouring down over you, and suddenly,\nthe whole of space starts singing out of solitude.\nYou're alone in space, cast out like a raft at sea,\nexposed to it like a dartboard to its darts, and you can no\nlonger run away from your destiny and anything can\nhappen. You can expect eagles or hawks to swoop down\nfrom the stars and cast themselves over you ina frenzy,\nbecause you\u2019re the only thing in the whole world that\u2019s\nsoft, something a beak can sink into, something a talon\ncan dig into; you can expect meteors or whatever to slit\nopen your bare breast, naked in the face of eternity; but\nthe only thing that happens is that space starts singing,\nspace starts singing out of solitude. \u2018The only thing\u2019 -\nbut no, it\u2019s more than just \u2018only\u2019, it\u2019s pretty horrible.\nThe odd song, you think you could no doubt put up\nwith the odd song; but that\u2019s not how it is: you can\u2019t put\nup with it, you just have to. \u2018Space\u2019, that silly little\nconcept you like playing around with when you're out\n188\n", "walking through the reeds and the trees, in parks or\nrefrigeration plants, or sitting in your rocking chair\nwatching the sky flickering over the top of the lilac\nhedge; space, the little lake where idyllic cloud boats\nglide along before the wind; space as it seems to be\nwhen you're still in the little hole on earth where you\nwere born, grew up, were ill-treated or ill-treated\nothers and where you're going to die any minute \u2014 that\nspace is just a lie for anyone who has experienced\nproperly this enormous, all-consuming, embittered\nsolitude, stuck on to a shiny metal field and with\nnothing around you and above you but the most\ngigantic, the loneliest of all wildernesses, the whole of\nspace, the true extent of which you never dared think\nabout while you were living in your hole on earth: it\u2019s\nlike a bottomless well, and you lean further and further\nout in the hope of seeing water, of seeing something\ntangible instead of just this terrifying emptiness, and in\nthe end you lean so far out, you fall, and then you fall\nand fall and fall for the whole of your life without\nexperiencing anything but this endless falling and you\ndie while you\u2019re still falling and although you haven\u2019t\ncome to any sign of a bottom you're annihilated while\nyou\u2019re still falling and gobbled up by the darkness after\nyour pitiful failed effort at filling it with meaning, the\nmeaning that comes from looking for a bottom.\n\nBut even so, you don\u2019t realize how huge this space is\nby falling or lying there stuck to the ground like that,\nfeeling the pressure against your chest; it\u2019s only when\nspace starts singing you begin to grasp what you\u2019ve had\nno idea about before, and you catch on with such\nshattering certainty that you\u2019d burst like a balloon if\nonly you could. But when you're lying there stuck so\nhopelessly to the magnet, there\u2019s nothing you can do\n\n189\n", "about it: all you can do is listen, you can\u2019t even raise\nyour hands and stick your fingers in your ears, and in\nany case: that wouldn\u2019t help either because when space\nis singing out of solitude, you\u2019re changed into a big,\ntense, listening ear and if you don\u2019t want to hear\nanything you'd need a meteor to stick into it, or a\nheavenly body might do, a star perhaps. As for the song\n- oh, it\u2019s so beautiful and yet terrible, it\u2019s the most\nbeautiful thing there is and yet the most horrible thing\nthere is. If only you could be killed by it, but all you can\ndo is lie there alive and let the song flow through you\nlike water through a turbine, and it will always be like\nthat, you feel space will always echo with solitude and\nyou yourself, a vulnerable ear, will lie there out-\nstretched over a heartless, naked surface listening to a\ncruelly beautiful song made even more cruel by the lack\nof echoes, atmospheric turbulence and earache.\n\nBut somehow or other: you must have been cured of\nthis solitude, or just simply fallen asleep; you wake up in\nyour hole on earth and see the usual little glimpse of\neternity smiling through between the roller blind and\nthe bed-end.\n\nSo, you're not alone any more, then, you think, all\nright, the awkward adventure, the desperate episode is\nover \u2014 and life goes on, a little bit less solitary all the\ntime; but in fact it\u2019s not over, it\u2019s only just beginning.\nYou sit in your room or you go out of your room, it\ndoesn\u2019t matter which, and you meet people or you don\u2019t\nsee a soul, it makes no difference, you talk to your wall\nor you don\u2019t say a word to your wall, you write a letter\nor you just buy a stamp, you set off on a journey or you\njust buy a ticket, you go out dancing or you just go to the\ndance hall, you do something or you don\u2019t do anything,\nyou let things go or you don\u2019t miss a trick; it makes no\n\n190\n", "difference, no difference at all: you'll always feel this\nglass wall separating you from everybody else even so,\nthis hard pane of glass you always carry around with\nyou and look through and are seen through and which\nyou brought back with you from your journey through\nspace. You're as isolated as a fever patient, and that\u2019s\nonly right: you\u2019ve got a higher fever than most people;\nyou could also say: you're as isolated as a condemned\nman, and that\u2019s also right: you're more fit to die than\nanybody else.\n\nYou're alone now as well, but in a worse way than\nyou were before; space isn\u2019t singing out of solitude,\nspace isn\u2019t singing at all: it\u2019s raining or snowing or it\u2019s\nwindy \u2014 but so what? You're alone in a dirty way, ina\nmiserly way, an unaesthetic way \u2014 and when there isn\u2019t\nany way out in any case (if ceasing to feel alone is in fact\na way out), don\u2019t be surprised that you long to be back\nin that huge space with its devilish but sublime music, its\nheartless but hygienic solitude, its absolute freedom\nfrom any kind of life, that\u2019s true, but at the same time an\nabsolute freedom from any necessity to seek company,\nto open doors where no doors exist, to smile when you\nfeel like crying, to caress when you feel like scratching,\nto look for friends when you have learnt that the world\nis full of enemies.\n\nYou long for moments of absolute self-effacement, of\nthe most brutal and sublime solitude with as much\nintensity as you can muster, with all the fire of your\ndreams; you have become a party to a dangerous secret,\nyou have been initiated into the use of a dangerous\npoison called solitude, and like a drug addict you now\ndivide your life into two periods: intoxication and\nrecovery. But what should you do when you\u2019re in your\nhole on earth? Should you try and acquire close friends?\n\n191\n", "~ No, because you're afraid, and probably rightly so,\nthat having a close friend, even if \u2018close\u2019 is as relative as\nyou like, will put you in an awkward position from the\noutset, for your chances of being flung out into wide,\ncold space will be all the fewer. You should keep people\nat arm\u2019s length, then - and come to that, the glass pane\nor the membrane surrounding you is of considerable\nhelp. Should you get yourself a mistress? \u2014 Yes, but only\nso that when a suitable moment comes, you can terrify\nher with your coldness, get her to hate you, to push you\naway from her with the coldest of hands, give you a\npush full of hatred which flings you head over heels into\nspace, that was just what you wanted \u2014 thank you very\nmuch! Or join the social whirl, perhaps, mixing with\nsympathizers and people of like mind, and letting\nyourself be bitten by the snakes slithering around the\nsalons and claiming they admire you, respect you, etc.\nOr why not expose yourself to the contempt of the\nwhole world, to the anger of the whole world, how you\ndo it is irrelevant, and the result is irrelevant come to\nthat as long as it can drive you into a state of absolute\nsolitude, if only it can make you hear once again how\nspace is singing out of solitude.\n\nAs he says to her one night, their last night in fact: the\ntrain is leaving the next morning with the three\nthousand volunteers and he\u2019s still quite a young man:\n\u201cWe\u2019re a special kind of person, we solitary ones, we're\na race on our own. We really ought to be marked in\nsome special way so that everybody can tell straight\naway and say to themselves: ah, he\u2019s one of those\nsolitary types, I\u2019d better leave him alone in case he\ninfects me, he\u2019s got big wounds under his clothes, like\nall of them have.\u2019\n\nHe stands there in front of the mirror in the hall made\n\n192\n", "brown from all the smoke, where all the inherited dark\nfurniture from the smoking room is, looking into a\nyoung face, tense with excitement, criss-crossed with\nsmall furrows caused by the despair he\u2019s already lived\nthrough, his eyes are shining and slightly bloodshot\nafter the whisky, his chin displays a souvenir of a\ncareless blow from an axe when he was a boy, a white\nscar sliding down towards his neck; it\u2019s not a handsome\nface, but it\u2019s quite an honest one, it tells surprisingly few\nlies for a face, and he thinks: I don\u2019t need a sign, you can\ntell by looking at me even so. But he covers the scar\nwith his scarf and continues talking to her while looking\nin the mirror and arranging his scarf, because he wants\nto leave shortly.\n\n\u201cWe could have a sign, as I said, a little patch sewn on\nto our chests, a patch with a big letter L, L for Lonely,\nLoner, Lonesome and all the other compounds beginning\nwith lone- ; just one sign, note, not two, not six, not a\nhundred. When we go out to war as volunteers, we\ncould...\u2019\n\n\u2018Ernst,\u2019 says his wife, in that gentle tone of voice you\nreserve for when you're feeling desperate and want a\nparticular person, but only him, to know you are, \u2018thank\nyou so much for torturing me so splendidly. I'll\nremember it always. But Ernst, don\u2019t go just yet - what\non earth will you do with yourself all night? Your train\ndoesn\u2019t go until six.\u2019\n\nHis rucksack is already packed and ready by the front\ndoor, ready to take off at any moment, a big, heavy bird\nthat\u2019s finally got tired of waddling around on land. He\nlooks first at his rucksack, then at his wife, and then\nback again, and he pictures to himself those long,\nmiserable streets lined with bare poplars all round the\nstation, and thinks about how he\u2019ll wander around\n\n193\n", "aimlessly, chain-smoking and watching the butts drown\nin puddles, whistling snatches of melodies as they come\ninto his head, being accosted by dubious types who\nthink he\u2019s looking for company, feeling cold and all\nalone but still not managing to get that lovely feeling of\nsolitude.\n\n\u2018All right,\u201d he says reluctantly, slowly loosening his\nscarf and examining his scar yet again, stroking it, \u2018all\nright, I suppose I might as well stay a bit longer \u2014 but\ndon\u2019t get any ideas.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut my dear Ernst,\u2019 she says, going and lying down\non the bed, \u2018I stopped getting ideas ages ago.\u2019\n\nWhen he comes in to her, she\u2019s naked under her\ndressing gown and, thanks to a carefully staged coinci-\ndence, she lets him notice. But he just pulls up a chair to\nthe side of the bed and sits down and looks at the little\npainting over the bureau, one of those things people\ninherit: a few cats are playing with a ball on a\npatchwork quilt. The frame is cracked in four different\nplaces, and he thinks how he could have mended it were\nit not for all that solitude that got in the way. But\nthere\u2019s a corner he\u2019s not looking at and he knows it\u2019s\nempty: all there is there is a few crumpled bills, but until\nlast Friday there used to be a desk there, and then it was\nsold all of a sudden. What\u2019s the use of a desk when you\ndon\u2019t write any more, when you've exposed the whole\nbusiness, the whole works, and there\u2019s a war on not far\naway, and you don\u2019t need a desk when you\u2019re there.\n\n\u201cBut darling,\u2019 she says, tugging away at his arm even\nthough he doesn\u2019t lie down beside her, \u2018surely you\nweren't going to go away without saying goodbye, I\nmean, that\u2019s the least one might have expected, don\u2019t\nyou think?\u2019\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d he asks, turning to look at the empty corner\n\n194\n", "so that he can really feel the pain inside him. \u201cWhy?\nWhy should that be the least you might have expected?\nI thought nobody expected anything of me any more.\nThere\u2019s nothing to be expected from here any more, oh\nno, we've closed down for today, we've closed down\nfor the night, we\u2019ve closed down for every day and\nevery night for as long as there are days and nights.\nCan\u2019t you see I\u2019m hollow, I\u2019m squeezed out, I\u2019m like a\nfish that\u2019s just been caught and bashed against a stone\nand it bursts and all its juices come spurting out. There\u2019s\nonly one thing I live for now, and that\u2019s nobody\u2019s\nbusiness. I\u2019m going, yes, OK, but not because I have any\nspecial desire to go clambering around in those\nmountains everybody\u2019s on about so much, or to start\nfighting with bayonets in all those tunnels. I\u2019ve no\ndesire at all to do anything. But you see, solitary types\nlike me are important for wars. We say to ourselves:\nhey, here\u2019s an unusually distinguished way of commit-\nting suicide. Here\u2019s a chance to die while still observing\nall the respectable rules, and you might even get a medal\nto hang on your tombstone as well: this is a death that\nmight satisfy both your vanity and your death wish -\nwhat more could you ask for?\u2019\n\nThe woman just lies there on the bed, calmly and\nquietly, and he can sit down beside her without her\nflinging herself on top of him.\n\n\u201cYou see, we don\u2019t care about which side we\u2019re on or\nanything like that. It\u2019s all the same to us, nothing\nmatters as far as we're concerned, and the generals\nwould be horrified if only they knew how many empty\nshadows they had in their army, how many who'd go\nover to the other side without any hesitation if only they\nknew they'd stand a better chance of being lonely in a\ndefinitive sort of way over there.\u2019\n\n195\n", "\u2018Good God,\u2019 she says softly; but before she knows\nwhat's happening, she\u2019d dug her nails into his thighs and\nis screaming at the top of her voice: \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, just\ngo away, can\u2019t you? Go away, get to hell out of here, I\nnever want to see you again, just leave me alone with all\nthe debts and this rotten life and the boy in hospital. You\ncouldn\u2019t care less that everybody\u2019s going on about you\nand calling you a ruthless bastard who\u2019s running away\nfrom everything without so much as a word of\nexplanation, not a single word, a ruthless . . .\u2019\n\nShe screams herself naked and writhes about like a\npatient in a high fever, and her throat is positively\nfoaming with all the curses.\n\n\u2018Just think, I might even have taken you seriously,\u2019 he\nsays, slapping her lightly on the throat and mouth until\nshe quietens down, \u2018if your anger hadn\u2019t reeked so much\nof sex!\u2019 He fastens her dressing gown for her as if he\nwere most offended, and before he gets up and leaves,\nhe takes one last, long look at the empty corner. He\nthinks he can see a shadow sneaking out of it and giving\nhim a contemptuous nod as it passes him on the way out;\na whole procession of shadows, in fact, some of them\npacing backwards and forwards between the desk and\nthe bed and representing the young dramatist Ernst\nWilson, chewing over some lines that never got\nproperly written, and the shadows rolling about on the\nfloor by the wall look remarkably like the not entirely\nuntalented young poet Ernst W. Wilson just three\nweeks ago. What's gone wrong? What kind of a\ntornado is it that\u2019s devastated this existence that seemed\nto be on its way to success?\n\nHis wife has stopped screaming, true, and now she\u2019s\ncrying instead; but you can\u2019t take into account every-\nbody in the world who starts crying, and now he really\n\n196\n", "is leaving: he closes the door behind him and can hear\nher crying, but it\u2019s too late to worry about that now.\nNo, he doesn\u2019t even feel that little pang which so often\ntries in vain to warn people when they\u2019ve done\nsomething bad. The rucksack is standing there in the\nhall, ready to fly, and he lets it do just that: you can leta\nrucksack do whatever it likes, a rucksack doesn\u2019t cry, a\nrucksack doesn\u2019t spoil things by shouting when you\nwant to hear space singing, you can say what you like to\na rucksack, it doesn\u2019t care whether you're cold or\nwarm; and they go off together the rucksack and Ernst\nW. Wilson, and wander along lots of the long,\nasphalted streets, all shiny with rain and loneliness, and\nall the time he is aware that something has happened for\nthe last time, it\u2019s as if he\u2019s been stricken by some\nincurable disease, or maybe incurable healthiness, it all\nboils down to the same thing in fact.\n\nAlready as he leans against a poplar tree and closes his\neyes and lets the wind and the rain flow over him, he can\nsee the desolate track leading straight into solitude, a\nbroad track, like a railway without rails, a heavy track\npressed down into the earth, whimpering, with flames\nrising up from it, and somebody is lying crushed\nbetween the wheels but the wheels just go on turning,\nheavy, implacable, stabbing down into the mud with\ntheir cogs, water seeps slowly up into the horses\u2019\nhoofmarks, smoke rises from the sand as the track passes\nthrough deserts, the snow screeches shrilly as it pro-\ngresses over wintry routes, many lie down wheezing\nand think they\u2019re drowning and just as they die, they\ndream the track is a log floating past them and all they\nneed to do is to grab hold of it and they'll be saved, and\nthey do grab hold of it with their fingers, but then new\nwheels come along the same track and crush their\n\n197\n", "fingers without any hint of mercy and then Ernst W.\nWilson appears, sweat pouring off him, and he\u2019s half-\nrunning in order to keep up, and he stands on the odd\nliver or kidney or stomach, there isn\u2019t much time you\nsee and they\u2019re all dying anyway and they\u2019re lying in\nsuch a way that you just have to stand on them if you\u2019re\ngoing to get past \u2014 and of course you do want to get past,\nyou want to follow that track as far as it goes, to the\npoint where it suddenly leaves this wicked earth and\nleaps out like a rainbow into space, the space that\u2019s\nsinging out of solitude.\n\nOne after another, cigarette ends sizzle and die on the\nasphalt that\u2019s slowly getting lighter, but the track just\nkeeps on going, on and on; it\u2019s a good track to follow, a\nstraight track, a track full of hatred and curses and he\u2019s\nnever going to leave it, he\u2019s going to love this track with\nall the hatred and all the love he can muster and trample\non anybody who tries to spoil it, who tries to debase it\nwith the stink of their rotting corpses, and with sweat\npouring off him he\u2019ll run along it through crunching\nsnow, through dusty sand, through sticky mud, through\nfields flowing with blood, and he'll be a private, then a\ncorporal and a sergeant and a lieutenant and a captain \u2014\nand the track will never desert him. He'll be faithful to\nhis track. He\u2019ll be faithful to his solitude and unfaithful\nto everything else.\n\nAnd just before dawn, when he and the girl go up to\nher room in a damp little riverside house, she flings\nherself straight down on to the bed in the alcove and he\nsays to her harshly, \u201cDon\u2019t get any ideas.\u2019\n\nAnd she replies, \u2018You don\u2019t get any ideas in this job.\nBut aren't you going to take off your rucksack?\u2019\n\nFeeling better, he takes off his rucksack and sits down\non the edge of the bed and he notices she\u2019s naked\n\n198\n", "underneath, but the way she shows it is less brazen than\nwhen his wife did it.\n\n\u2018You've got undressed for nothing,\u2019 he says. \u2018I just\nwant to have a little chat for a while, just a chat.\u2019\n\n\u2018Go on then,\u2019 she says, closing her eyes.\n\n\u201cWhy are you closing your eyes?\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve no desire to see you naked.\u2019\n\n\u2018Have you ever felt really lonely?\u2019\n\n\u201cYou're never lonely in this job.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 he says, and wanders off although his body stays\non the bed for a while and his nose can smell all the men\n\u2014 the sweat, sandwiches and whisky - who have cashed\nin their despair in the alcove, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve felt so lonely, so\nlonely and so happy.\u2019\n\nAnd he goes on to recall all the sublime moments of\nsolitude when everything has sunk out of existence,\npeople, needs and thoughts, and only that fearful music\nwas left to flood his being. A little boy is left behind in\nthe grass, very high grass; he can\u2019t walk properly yet,\nand they\u2019ve just seen a long, black grass snake wriggling\nunder a tuft of grass and all the other children have\nraced back to the house screaming, but they've for-\ngotten about him, because you can\u2019t run as fast as you'd\nlike to if you\u2019re dragging along a little boy who still\ncan\u2019t walk properly because he\u2019s been ill, they\u2019ve just\nleft him behind with his fear, his extreme terror of the\nblack snake. He\u2019s just about to start crying and already\nhe can see the house and the long, soft grass through a\nsurging haze of tears, but then the rain starts falling,\nviolent and brutal rain that hammers away with its fists\non all the roofs and swishes down into the grass and the\nabandoned boy is soaked to the skin straight away.\nThere\u2019s a dull rumbling behind the house and suddenly\nthe thunderstorm approaches, lightning crawls over the\n\n199\n", "roof and rain comes pouring down the path and swirls\nabout at his feet, the grass hangs down like hair when\nyou've just been swimming and then, all of a sudden, he\nrealizes he\u2019s not afraid, not the slightest bit afraid any\nmore, he\u2019s so alone, so abandoned by everybody, but it\nfeels good to be alone, good to be abandoned. All there\nis in the whole world apart from himself is this wet\ngrass, the rain, and the thunderstorm; there\u2019s nobody\nleft to pull his hair, to force him to chew his food even\nthough everything he\u2019s ever eaten in all his life is rising\nup into his throat, the lightning doesn\u2019t have any whips\nand the grass doesn\u2019t have any nails and the rain doesn\u2019t\nhave any harsh voices - and that\u2019s why he starts\nscreaming like a thing possessed and kicks and struggles\nlike the very devil when somebody suddenly remembers\nabout him once it\u2019s stopped raining and runs out to fetch\nhim in.\n\nAnd then another time his piggy bank is lying in\npieces on the sideboard like a shattered dream, and he\u2019s\nstolen money from himself so that he can buy a little\natlas showing all the countries where he can be alone,\nand his father, a chauffeur for the upper classes, beats\nhim into solitude with a little whip. How delighted he is\nwhen he suddenly realizes he can get away from\neverything and everybody with the aid of a little whip,\nand he\u2019s in a state of ecstasy as the lashes cut into him;\nand then he remembers all the times when he does what\nseem to be the strangest things, the most disgusting\ndeeds, the cruelest acts, just so that somebody will beat\nhim into another world, that everybody will hate him\ninto that sweet solitude. The time comes when he\u2019s too\nold for that sort of thing, but he takes secret delight in\ndiscovering all the possibilities opened up by self-\ntorture: you can take your protective membrane with\n\n200\n", "you and move among people who are all laughing and\nwith no effort at all turn their laughter into arrows that\ntear your heart open; or you can be desperate for sex but\njust as desperate for deprivation and on midsummer eve\nyou can stroll about the big public parks where\neverybody\u2019s making love all over the place in the grass,\nand take bitter delight in feeling your heart fill up with\ntears; there\u2019s so much you can do when you're that age,\nwhen you're sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen,\ntwenty, and every day God gives you can discover even\nmore things.\n\nYou can discover contempt, for instance: oh how\nlovely it is, how delightful, to recall some twisted\nmemory of laughter distorted by contempt, thousands\nof red lips, all of them curled in disgust, and to be\nlaunched by them into the solitude of space. There\u2019s\nthat time when the middle-aged stoker on the little\ncoaster he worked on as an ordinary seaman when he\nwas still at school invites him into his cabin and seduces\nhim after making him feel disgusted by all the nasty\nsmells women have and all the diseases they spread and\ngetting him to drink a few glasses of whisky, and what\ntakes place is so surprising that he doesn\u2019t get round to\nputting up any resistance, it\u2019s so incredibly novel, it\u2019s as\nif some animal he\u2019s never seen before has suddenly\nrevealed itself to him and rendered him helpless through\nsurprise and fear; but afterwards, when he goes back\nover the deck in the dark and down into the dormitory,\nhe feels so dirty, he wants to jump overboard and drown\nhimself in order to get clean. And all the ones playing\ncards and all the ones writing letters turn to look at him\nat exactly the same time as he comes down the ladder.\n\n\u2018How did you get on with Christian, then?\u2019 one of\nthem shouts.\n\n201\n", "\u2018I hope you were really nice to him,\u2019 another one\nbellows.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s about time you got yourself a boyfriend,\u2019 yells a\nthird. But nobody hits him, nobody laughs, and in the\nend everybody\u2019s face is stiff with contempt, and he\u2019s\ninfectious, and everybody else has gone into quarantine.\nHe just stands there with his arms dangling and feels\ntheir contempt seeping into his blood, and then he\nrealizes with a feeling of enormous happiness that he\ncouldn\u2019t care less, it\u2019s just good that people feel\ncontempt for him, perhaps the best thing that could\npossibly happen, and he has no problems at all when he\ngoes back again up the ladder after one of them shouts,\n\u2018Clear off, you\u2019ve no business round here! Go back to\nChristian, you can sleep in his cabin from now on!\nThere\u2019s plenty of room for you as well in his bed.\u201d\n\nAnd so he stays in Christian\u2019s cabin for the rest of the\ntrip because that makes him lonelier than ever and you\ncan get used to anything and there are ways of lying like\na desert island miles away from anywhere: true, it can\nbe plundered and pillaged, but when the plunderers and\npillagers have gone away the water is still lapping\naround its shores and it\u2019s still just as remote as it ever\nwas, as long as nobody builds a bridge to it.\n\nBut he\u2019s brought back to school, and time passes and\nheals all wounds and a romantic teacher tricks him into\nbelieving there\u2019s such a thing as sublimation, you can\nsublimate your urges, you can get away from all your\nbad experiences by experiencing all your actions on an\ninner plain. He leaves school and starts work in a\nsolicitor\u2019s office, works as a language teacher, gets\nmarried early and becomes a father and hasn\u2019t felt any\nurge to travel out into the world of solitude for ages,\nbecause somebody has told him the only possible way of\n\n202\n", "doing things is the normal way, and all you can do is to\nlaugh in the right place and cry in the right place and\nconform to all the conventions and only go against them\non an inner plain, the popular inner plain; you want to\nbe happy after all, and happiness means being ruthless\nwith yourself and considerate towards everybody else,\nand then again: time itself has bidden farewell to all\nfreebooters of the soul.\n\nHe sits on the girl\u2019s bed as the hairy dawn creeps\nanimal-like over the window-pane, and diagonally\nopposite the house is a bridge and when the two halves\nof the bridge start to open all the sand in the tramlines\nslides down like white beams and dives into the water.\n\n\u2018Hey,\u2019 he says to the girl, grabbing her by the\nshoulder for she\u2019s fallen asleep, \u2018you should have seen\nme marching backwards and forwards along that\ntriangle between the table, the bed and the window,\ntrying to condense my solitude and to believe that I was\nthe greatest because I\u2019d been the most solitary of all, and\nall the time being aware of how impotent I was,\nunderstanding all that poetry business, which was a\nwaste of time in fact because nobody was interested,\nand knowing full well that whatever went on between\nme and my desk was just a pitiful case of opting out.\nSometimes I nearly choked, and managed to save myself\nat the last minute by throwing myself to the ground and\nripping my clothes off; I felt | was being got at, and I\nscreamed at my wife: Why are you getting at me? I\u2019m\nnot your judge, she said. No, you\u2019re my executioner, I\nyelled. I don\u2019t have a chopper, she yelled back. No, but I\ndo, I screamed back at her - and so it went on: our\nconfrontations went on for ever and ever without end,\nlike an escalator, and I was choking more and more and\nnot getting anywhere on any front. But one evening a\n\n203\n", "couple of weeks ago when I was all on my own ~ she\u2019d\nleft me, just for the time being, as usual \u2014 I suddenly\noverturned the table and stood it in front of me like a\nbarricade, because I was convinced somebody had just\ncome into the room with the aim of attacking me, biting\nme to pieces, crunching me between his teeth, and it\nwasas if I\u2019d just been bashed violently on the back of the\nhead: the room disappeared, erased from my con-\nsciousness by a giant witha rubber, and I was consumed\nby a dazzling light and then I was lying once again on\nthe shiny surface in the midst of space, and everything\nwas so boundlessly silent at first, and then there was a\nwhining sound as if a drop of water had let go and had\nsuddenly started falling at tremendous speed through\neternity, and then there was that invisible rain that\nalways came before the song started \u2014 and then space\nwould start singing and I could see myself like an ear,\njust growing and growing out of the ground, and once\nwhen I woke up my room was just the same as it always\nwas but I was sweating because of the singing and I\ndidn\u2019t realize that I would never again be able to run\naway from my solitude, least of all by using artificial\nmethods like poetry, and all the past homed in on my\nscent and flung itself upon me and | got the strange\nfeeling that I was a woman and a man at the same time\nand I got dressed up in my wife\u2019s clothes and I got drunk\nand I masturbated and suddenly I found I had something\nto do up in the attic. Nobody saw me going, but when I\ngot to the attic door I found I\u2019d forgotten the key, and I\ncould hear a noise on the stairs and when I leaned over\nthe rail I could see a mass of black figures, among them\nmy wife, on their way upstairs. I curled up into a ball on\nthe attic stairs in the hope that no one would notice me,\nbut, needless to say, somebody grabbed me by the\n204\n", "shoulder and rolled me over. Why, Ernst, somebody\nshouted, and I ran into my room but they came racing\nafter me. I looked round the room in a panic and was\nshattered to see that the disorder everything was in was\na woman\u2019s disorder, a slightly confused disorder, not\nthe spiky, brutal disorder a man creates. I pushed my\ndesk into the corner and crouched behind it so that I\ncould defend myself.\n\n\u201cWhat do you know about solitude?\u2019 I yelled at them,\n\u201cWhat do you know about the great solitude of space?\nYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like when space starts singing\nout of solitude. You may have read poems about it, you\nmay have heard something about it in Gothic novels -\nbut that\u2019s about all.\u2019\n\n\u2018But,\u2019 I screeched in a voice that rose up as wild as a\nstallion, for the executioner within me had grasped the\naxe outside me and chopped off my normal, decent self,\n\u201cwhat is the whole of literature compared with a single\nsuicide? What is life but an unsuccessful suicide attempt?\nWhat\u2019s the point of decency in life compared with the\ndecency of death?\u2019\n\n\u201cBut now it\u2019s all over and done with,\u2019 he says to the\ngirl, who has fallen asleep again. \u2018I\u2019ve sold out, and\nthere\u2019s only one way out now.\u2019 And he wakes her up\ncruelly and stuffs a banknote into her ear.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t hear a word you said,\u2019 she says, yawning,\n\u2018but thanks all the same.\u2019 He\u2019s already hoisted the\nrucksack on to his shoulders and is on his way to the\nstation.\n\nAnd the track slices its way through the deserts, it\nglows blood-red in the sunsets and he runs through it\nand his sweat and his blood spurt out of him like a\nfountain, and he curses the track as well as loving the\ntrack, and it\u2019s covered in pure white snow which\n\n205\n", "crunches under his feet and under the wheels, and rib-\ncages of animals and humans stick up like white spikes\nout of the track, and in the rivers the skeletons of\nancient, wrecked ships all look the same; occasionally,\nfires flare up alongside the track and sometimes he feels\nfires burning within him, but the best he can do is to\nkeep going with the only hope he has left now that all\nthe others have gone bankrupt: that the track will dare\nto make the final leap into solitude, that gigantic\nsolitude where solitude itself sings, and the best thing to\ndo is to sacrifice everything, to be faithful to your\nsolitude and unfaithful to everything else, and maybe\nthe track will pass over Boy Larus at an acute angle, or\nmaybe one of the other survivors, and press down on to\nhis rib-cage, or somebody else\u2019s, because there is always\na hope, the only great hope left: the hope that the final\nleap will be from that very rib-cage, that very heart.\n206\n", "THE STRUGGLE OVER THE LION\n", "Such a little volcano for such a big fire\n", "He must have suddenly acquired the vacant look of a\nmurderer or a drunk, because everybody starts staring\nat him, leaning forward over the empty water keg, or so\nhe thinks, and their movements betray both menace and\nfear. Somebody has woken them up by screaming, and\nthe shock at being so rudely awakened is still flitting\nabout their faces. Worried stiff, he moves a few steps to\none side so that the sun won\u2019t expose him even more.\nThe captain slowly turns his hip to the right, towards\nhim, and his clenched fist hovers just below it, as if he\nhad a revolver at the ready underneath his rags.\n\nThat was stupid of me, thinks Lucas Egmont, that\nwas really stupid of me. Why didn\u2019t I think of my\ngormless face which gives away everything I\u2019ve done\nand everything I will ever do: I might just as well shout\nout what I\u2019ve done at the top of my voice, and then it\nwouldn't feel so awful, so damned creepy. It feels as if\nmy face were covered in crawling ants, and I can\u2019tlifta\nfinger to shift them, because nobody\u2019s supposed to\nknow they\u2019re there.\n\nNow the captain bends over towards him at a\nridiculous angle, and his hand is trembling as if he were\non the point of going for his revolver. They don\u2019t\n\n209\n", "m straight away, they just come close\nnd yet at the same time as cowed asa lion\n", "later it gets hotter and hotter, water fit for actions,\nthoughts, feelings to bathe in, water condemned to stop\nbeing clean but maybe it doesn\u2019t have to become all that\ndirty, water that\u2019s destined to be emptied out when the\nbather hasn\u2019t the strength to wash off any more dirt - if\na human being\u2019s a bath-tub like that, then there'll be a\npoint in his life when the plug is suddenly pulled out by\nsome unseen hand, and all the water, cool now, full of\ndirt and purity, flows out of him and the gurgling of\ndeath as it pours down the drain first fills him with\nhorror, and then with resignation, and in the end he just\nlongs for the same unknown hand that pulled out the\nplug to come with a brush and scrub away the rim of\ndirt from the sides of the bath. But with a pitiful sort of\nwhimper, the last drops of dirty water are sucked down\ninto the black hole and the tub becomes silent and\nempty, the bath-tub is dead and darkness falls over the\nbathroom. A key is turned in the lock from the outside,\nand the bathroom is closed once and for all: there\u2019ll be\nnobody else taking a bath in this bathroom.\n\nThey remember the scream - but who screamed?\nThey can hear the roar of the breakers \u2014 but where does\nit come from? They\u2019re scared already \u2014 but why? They\nwalk slowly back up the beach, towards the cliff, and a\ncluster of iguanas that have evidently been lying there\nwatching them turn back slowly and defiantly and\nshuffle up towards the grass. Then they stop and\nhesitate, and the smell of the corpse under the canvas\nsheet wafts over to them in broad waves of velvet and\nthreatens to choke them. They\u2019re filled with death,\nthey\u2019re like vases that have been standing for so long in\nan empty room that both the flowers and the water have\ngone musty.\n\n_ The scream hovers over their heads, it has the\n211\n", "ruthless shadow of a gallows, and the weaker their\nmemory of what it sounded like, the more tangible it\nbecomes. The scream gets hotter and hotter, and they\nall start sweating; the scream turns into this shadow,\nand they all shiver with the cold like dogs; the scream is\nin the way the iguanas move and in the lazy rustling\nsound from the plateau and the scream is hiding under a\ncanvas sheet, which is held down on to the sand by\nstones so that it won't suddenly rise up and reveal what\nnobody wants to see.\n\nAnd what\u2019s all this about the water keg?\n\n2\n\nThere\u2019s nothing you can do about it: you take a glass and\nempty it, or you take an evil deed from the pile of\nundone deeds and carry it out \u2014 and all at once, you look\ndifferent. As far as you\u2019re concerned, it\u2019s something you\ncan put up with. You yourself are not too worried\nabout what you\u2019ve done, but it\u2019s as if there were\nmuscles in your face which like playing at being your\nconscience.\n\nA few brisk winds have got up, and just for amoment\nblown away the sticky sweet smell of death out into the\nlagoon, so that it\u2019s easier to talk again.\n\n\u2018It must have been one of us who did it,\u2019 says the\ncaptain. \u201cThe water can\u2019t have run out of its own accord\nlike this.\u2019\n\nAs he speaks, sweat comes crawling over his face.\nBig, grey beads of sweat, sweat that looks scared. They\nall move closer to each other, as if they could avoid\ndeath that way. The captain hardly has room to swing\nhis revolver hand round, even. They have their backs\n\n212\n", "turned towards the beach, and they\u2019re facing the cliffs,\nas if they were expecting to be gunned down from\nbehind.\n\n\u201cNo, somebody must have done it.\u2019 Boy Larus echoes\nhis words, but his voice is so uncertain that everyone\napart from Lucas Egmont glances up at him and his eyes\nshy away like a horse, because no innocent person can\nlook as innocent as a guilty man.\n\nIt\u2019s his temples, his cheek-bones and profile that give\nthe game away. It\u2019s always been the same, thinks Lucas\nEgmont, the tiniest glass of wine and everybody can tell\njust by looking at me that I\u2019ve been on the booze. I could\nhit a fish on a stone and afterwards look like a double\nmurderer. It\u2019s too late now of course - God knows I\u2019ve\ngot used to the idea of dying! \u2014 it\u2019s too late now, but I\nshould have always carried a mask to hide behind.\n\nThey haven\u2019t noticed anything yet, though; they\u2019re\nmore scared of the dead boxer than of the dead water\nkeg. Tim Solider was the one who'd come up with the\nidea of the stones. We must do something to stop the\ncanvas from blowing away, he\u2019d said the previous night\nwhen he was pacing up and down restlessly between the\nfire and the rambling English girl; something that'll\nkeep the smell in until we can bury him.\n\nTim Solider is very scared of the smell, more scared\nof the smell than of anything else. He once had an aunt\nwho lived on her own in an attic room, and she used to\nsay until the day she died that you should go to a funeral\nor a house where somebody\u2019s just died, and take note of\nhow you can smell the corpse, because just before you\ndie you'll notice a similar smell coming from your own\nbody and you'll lock yourself in and scrub yourself\ndown, but nothing helps, there\u2019s nothing more you can\ndo.\n", "Bunched tightly together, like a winning football\nteam leaving the pitch, they walk up the cliffs and the\nmorning is as clear as a peach although the air is terribly\ndifficult to breathe. They stop, panting, after almost\nevery other step and pretend to look round, to gaze out\nto sea, to peer at the clouds in the sky or the peaceful\nhorizon; but it\u2019s all a put-on act, for no one must hear\nthat you're out of breath, no one must know that you\u2019re\nbleeding, and when you cry, it must always be hidden\nby asmile. Oh yes, everything\u2019s a put-on act: hardly any\nof them knows what the sea or the sky looks like this\nmorning, because if they do look out to sea, all they can\nmake out is an oblong bundle, half-covered by a canvas\nsheet, tossing in the waves, and an unpleasantly familiar\nkeg rolling slowly in towards land, and the whole of the\nsky is obscured by the dead body and the empty water\nkeg.\n\nOh, how they hate him. Imagine being so isolated,\nand still being so betrayed. It feels like having been set\ndown in the desert, with no hope of rescue \u2014 and then\neven being robbed of the salvation offered by the empty\nwater keg. They hate him, but the ashes of fear are\nraining down all the time, and as they climb up towards\nthe plateau, where the smell can\u2019t reach because its\nwings are too heavy, the dead body is slowly covered by\nthose ashes, and soon there\u2019s nothing left but an\ninadequate outline of his memory \u2014 and then when they\nstop to get their breath, the whole beach is filled by a\ngigantic water keg, and they start back slightly in\nsurprise, and now they\u2019re even less keen to look at one\nanother than before; but when they hastily turn their\nbacks on the beach, they imagine they can still see that\nsame, nasty tank falling slowly over in the grass and\nreluctantly disappearing, for fear is a cunning beacon\n\n214\n", "which isn\u2019t satisfied with useless symbols when there\nare so many useful ones.\n\nIn their eagerness to get away from the corpse\nthey've got as far as the first bushes and it\u2019s there, on the\nsteep, shiny cliff, its green furrows glistening in the\nsunlight, that the first explosion occurs. Tim Solider is\nstanding like a negro with his arms dangling, and staring\nat the mysterious bushes which still frighten him just as\nmuch as they did at the start, he\u2019s just parted some\nbranches and peered into the green darkness, and then\nwith a sudden start, as if he'd unexpectedly caught sight\nof a snake in the woods, he jerks back his hand - and at\nthat very moment of terror, the captain pounces on him,\nalmost like a tiger. His heavy body crashes into Tim\nSolider\u2019s with potentially cruel force and they fall over\nmore or less straight away, locked closely together, and\nTim Solider\u2019s back smacks into the rock with a\nsickening, dull thud. Perhaps he\u2019s broken something, or\nsomething\u2019s been crushed: he just lies there at first and\nignores the way the captain is pounding away non-stop\nat his chest with his clenched fists.\n\nThere follows a brief moment of silence as the\ncaptain, sure of his superiority, stops punching; the\nwhole world falls silent save for the panting of the two\nmen. Someone has stifled the pain of the sea, the wind\nhas suddenly dropped, and not even the iguanas clatter\nover the stones, although on the cliff face just below the\ntwo combatants, two large iguanas are lying motion-\nless, evidently watching them.\n\nLucas Egmont is the first to notice their potential\nmenace. The iguanas on the island have short, wiry,\nimmobile eyelids which have had many thousand years\nin which to shrink; behind those permanently open\ncurtains, their eyes always seem as though they are\n\n215\n", "crouching ready to jump, but they also have lazy bodies\nwhich, thanks to congenital idleness, always hold the\nleap in check. But the two iguanas lying motionless in\nwait just below the captain and Tim Solider seem\nsuddenly to have lost their iguana-souls, and intense\nfury is almost threatening to burst their shells. They\u2019re\nlying so very, very still, but that\u2019s just the fateful\ngathering of strength before an enormous leap.\n\nThen he notices the thin brown liquid trickling down\nthe rock and sees how the iguanas let it pass between\nthem, their bodies tensed and threatening, and then it all\nfalls into place. He gropes around for an arm to catch on\nto, but fails to find one as he is standing all alone. He\nwants to shout a warning, but can\u2019t as the captain is\nbending over Tim Solider\u2019s face and screaming, \u201cYou\ndid it, you bastard. You\u2019re the one who emptied out the\nwater, you're the one who unscrewed the tap and let it\nall run out of the keg. You\u2019re the one who tried to trick\nus saying you\u2019d found some food, you're the one who\nbrought us a box of glass beads and said: Here you are\nladies and gentlemen, I\u2019ve brought some food for you.\nOh, don\u2019t think I don\u2019t know how much you hate us, just\nbecause you\u2019re inferior to us, because you were put into\nthe world in order to serve people. And so you thought\nyou'd murder us, because let\u2019s face it, from the moment\nyou emptied that water keg you became a murderer, my\nfriend. When you murdered us, you thought: now we'll\nsee who\u2019s strongest, who\u2019s going to live longest! Ha ha,\nI'll laugh at them when they\u2019re writhing in agony, and\nwhen I start writhing in agony I'll still go on laughing.\nOh yes, I know what you were thinking all right, but\nyou were wrong, you mark my words, because when\nwe start getting thirsty, when we start getting visions of\nwells and streams and springs, you won't be alive any\n\n216\n", "more. You won't be alive any more the moment we\nstart getting thirsty. We'll all be out of our minds with\nfear and thirst and we'll shout: Where\u2019s the murderer?\nand somebody will reply: There he is, he\u2019s marching up\nand down on the hill up there, and then we'll all chase\nhim till he drops and we'll leap on him with all the\nstrength our fury gives us, and if anybody tries to\nprotest about what we\u2019re doing, we'll say: It\u2019s only a\nmurderer, it\u2019s only a murderer getting his well-\ndeserved punishment.\u2019\n\nOh, how scared he feels while he\u2019s yelling and\nscreaming, how full of morning air he fills his lungs as\nhe forces out his fear so that it spatters all over the man\nlying underneath him, but the man underneath him has\nplenty of fear of his own, and he wriggles and writhes as\nhe tries to get out of the grasp of the squashed iguana.\nAn iguana you have squashed between your back and a\nrock after a violent fall is surely not something you\nshould be afraid of, but even so he can feel the dead\niguana\u2019s body swelling up beneath him until eventually\nthe whole of his is resting on it and the cold rises up\naround his hips like a wave of death and then when he\nmanages to turn his head and sees the thin brown trail\ncontaining the iguana\u2019s life-blood trickling down the\ncliff he opens his mouth wide and shrieks in a frenzy,\n\u2018The iguanas! Watch out for the iguanas!\u2019\n\nBut everybody except Lucas Egmont thinks he\u2019s\ntrying to get away with what he\u2019s done, and trembling\nwith an excess of obedience and an excess of fear, Boy\nLarus goes up to him and bends over him and spits\nstraight in his face. At the same time, the captain sits up\nso that he\u2019s astride Tim Solider\u2019s knees and that\u2019s what\nsaves him for the time being. The iguanas have been\nslowly and apparently nonchalantly getting closer and\n\n217\n", "suddenly they attack, their heavy bodies leap forwards\nas if borne by a flash of lightning, and side by side but on\neach side of the brown trickle they crash into Tim\nSolider\u2019s chest in sickening unison. They bite straight\nthrough his thin shirt and into his flesh, and hang on\nlimply like rats as the blood oozes up around their\narmoured snouts. All his blood seems to be flowing\ndown to his wound and his face turns quite yellow as it\ndoes on a corpse and when Lucas Egmont kneels down\nbeside him, his eyes have crept back into their horror\nand the nails on one of his hands are scratching and\nscratching away at the rock till they bend backwards.\n\nThe iguanas are completely passive again, but the\nleap is still trembling in their bodies and in their\ntreacherous eyes, and when Lucas Egmont gropes\naround over Tim Solider\u2019s chest he can feel the\ncreatures trembling inside their shells, lying there like\ntime bombs, incredibly sensitive to every pressure. As\nhe draws back his arm he can feel from the silence just\nhow lonely he is in the world, and when he glances\nquickly round without letting the iguanas out of his\nsight even so, all four of them are standing quite closely\ntogether, at the mid-point between his fear and his\nhatred.\n\n\u201cCome and help me,\u2019 he shouts. \u201cWe must get them\noff him before he bleeds to death.\u2019\n\nBut no one budges an inch. They just stand there\nirresolutely, like the chief mourners by a graveside after\nthe final oration. Boy Larus makes a symbolic move as if\npreparing to jump, but is easily stopped by the captain\u2019s\nfoot.\n\nThen Lucas Egmont crouches down beside Tim\nSolider, takes hold of his hand and pushes it in front of\nhim like a shield over the red battlefield of his chest, and\n\n218\n", "as he watches the limp, insensitive hand sliding forwards\nslowly towards its goal, it occurs to him with the\nsuddenness of a flash of lightning how shatteringly\nfamiliar it all is. This hand is a hand he\u2019s seen in his\ndreams, time and time again he\u2019s hidden behind the big,\nyellow hand as its fingers drag it in fits and starts over\nthe red dress, and behind it there have always been\nanimals, hidden but dauntingly present, silent but\nbellowing out their silence, motionless but burrowing\ntheir way into his breast. So everything important and\nshocking in one\u2019s life is just a re-run of one\u2019s nightmares,\neverything that happens has happened so many times\nbefore; how often has one been forced to suffer the\nsame, familiar pain?\n\nBut while the hand is still on its way towards the\ninvisible iguana snouts and the unconscious man starts\nshivering as he\u2019s on the point of regaining conscious-\nness, Lucas Egmont hears the patter of tiny, tiny feet on\nthe rocks behind him. Someone has stepped outside the\nmagic circle, and he shudders as the female footsteps\ncome nearer and nearer, and when they\u2019re as near as\nthey can get he can feel how the animal he\u2019s trying to\nforget has imbued the footsteps with its supple caution \u2014\nand then comes the scream:\n\n\u2018Leave them alone,\u2019 she yells. \u2018Leave them alone,\u2019\nyells Madame, and even while she\u2019s screaming she bends\nright down and strokes the iguanas \u2014 and they don\u2019t\nreact at all. Then she raises her arm like a victory\npennant and goes on talking, calmer, more rationally,\nnot quite so loudly now she\u2019s found her Jesus, ready to\nlet himself be bitten by her iguanas, ready to be killed\nreluctantly in her stead.\n\n\u201cLeave them alone,\u2019 says the woman who\u2019s overcome\nher fear by letting it bite someone else, \u2018leave them\n\n219\n", "alone. It\u2019s too late anyway. Let him take his punish-\nment, it\u2019s no more than he deserves after all, it\u2019s no\nmore than a murderer deserves, after all.\u2019\n\nHe can hear the patter of her feet as she walks away,\nbut it doesn\u2019t sound like an animal any more, not now\nwhen she no longer needs to be afraid. But now\nsomething is happening to Lucas Egmont: so far\neverything that has happened since that incident with\nthe water keg has been just as real or just as unreal as a\ndream; in your dreams, you can feel scared and sweat\ncan be pouring off you, but in some vague way you feel\nthat it\u2019s all a charade, and because all the time,\nsomewhere back there beyond all the smoke and cloud,\nyou can just about make out the curtain that'll fall when\nyou simply can\u2019t go on any longer, when you can\u2019t\nbecome any more frightened than you already are\nwithout bursting, precisely because of all that, the fear\nof dreams and the guilty conscience of dreams are never\ndefinitive, there\u2019s always a clear dividing line between\ndeath and the extremes of suffering \u2014 but in real life\nthere\u2019s a line beyond which balancing acts are no longer\npossible, a line beyond which you lose all vestiges of\nearthly peace, innocence and happiness, and that\u2019s the\nline between dreams and extreme awareness: you're\nliving in the world of dreams, you're breathing the air\nof dreams, but at the same time you're cruelly aware\nthat the dream\u2019s over this time, and reality is more real\nthan ever, and the terror of your dream has escaped\nfrom its dark cage and in the brightest of bright daylight\nit\u2019s wrapping its snake-like body round your neck.\n\nSuddenly, then, Lucas Egmont emerges from his long\ndream of thirst, and it\u2019s in that dream everything has\nbeen happening: it\u2019s in that dream he has returned to a\nskilfully disguised childhood, it\u2019s in that dream the big\n\n220\n", "fish with its long sword has momentarily pierced the\nsurface of the bay and transformed the tiny lagoon into\nan ocean of terror, it\u2019s in that dream Lucas Egmont has\nemptied the drinking water, their last hope, into the\nsand, and it\u2019s in that dream he has watched nonchalantly\nas the five survivors possessed by the fear of death have\nhunted down the guilty man, nonchalant because it was\nall so unreal, because everything that happened was\nmerely the only possible continuation of a bad dream -\nand hence his plunge into wakefulness is so horrific, he\nsuddenly goes all stiff and can feel the sun, can feel the\nsun for the first time, cutting into his neck like a knife,\nand how the air is forcing its way into him and\npummelling his lungs, and the stones are starting to get\nhot and burning his skin, and the acrid smell from the\nbleeding man on the cliff suddenly sets him panting in\ndisgust \u2014 and then all the screams from all the terrified\npeople on the island are vibrating in his ears, and the\nagonizing spotlights of reality are drenching his whole\nbeing with their steely beams.\n\nBut worse of all is the blood, the blood that has\nbrought him to his senses, and suddenly Tim Solider\u2019s\nhand is sticky and red and the lukewarm liquid is\nsuddenly crawling beneath his own hesitant fingers like\na toad - and he\u2019s overcome by utter helplessness,\nswamped by an unstoppable surging sea of terror, and it\ntakes possession of him and all the pointless things he has\ndone on the island come charging towards him like\nbulls, and they gore him with their horns and trample\nhim with their hooves and the ocean of terror hasn\u2019t a\nsingle island of forgiveness. Sacrifice everything and\ndie, it roars to all the miserable creatures wallowing in\ntheir own degradation and gradually realizing just how\npitiful they are, sacrifice everything and die \u2014 and the\n\n221\n", "pitiful wretch sacrifices everything and dies or survives\naccording to his strength. Oh, you paradoxical hero!\nOh, what wretched bravery!\n\nLucas Egmont must have been born lucky, because\nalmost without trying he manages to stick his fingers\ninto the mouth of the lower of the iguanas and then he\nprises its jaws open with a violent heave which almost\nsevers his hand from his wrist, and just look: the iguana\nfalls away, bleeding from its mouth, and thuds on to the\nrock and he sets upon it with all the strength his terror\ngives him and he whips it over on its back and kicks it in\nthe belly till it slides away down the face of the cliff and\ncrashes on to the rocks on the beach below. When he\nspins round, trembling all over from a mixture of effort\nand fear, to meet the new danger, Tim Solider is alone\nwith his wounds, but a narrow reddish-black line wends\nits way over the rock and into a giant bush. A strangely\nbitter smell of decay is wafted by the breeze from the\nundergrowth, as if some dead body were lying in\nambush there. A cold shudder runs down his spine.\n\nThey\u2019re still on their own; the other four, the captain\nand Boy Larus, Madame and the English girl are all\nclambering slowly down to the beach where the fire is\nunwinding its never-ending string of smoke. Lucas\nEgmont tears strips off his shirt and presses some of\nthem into the wounds. The cloth quickly turns dark red,\nand he lifts Tim Solider on to his shoulder and starts to\ncarry him down the cliff face as a red wave of blood\nflows up into Tim\u2019s face like a flame, and he starts\nwhimpering like an animal as he crawls back into\nconsciousness.\n\nThen the English girl screams. She\u2019s flung herself into\nthe shallows near the dead boxer and is coating her hair\nwith sand in a series of hysterical gestures.\n\n222\n", "\u201cWhy did you have to kill him? You murdered him,\nthat\u2019s what you did! You just come here and I'll. . .\u2019\n\nBut for the moment they all keep a respectful\ndistance.\n\n3\n\nEventually, they gather around her in a circle, or\nrather: a semi-circle. Tim Solider joins in as well; he\u2019s\ngroggy but he\u2019s regained consciousness, the bleeding\nhas stopped, he\u2019s very weak but he walks stiffly, straight\nas a ramrod, a skeleton of terror holding him together.\nHe\u2019s afraid they'll gang up on him again and if he falls\nasleep, use that as an excuse to kill him. That\u2019s why he\nhardly dares look down at the sand: it seems to have eyes\nsucking him down towards them, his knees are buckling,\na dull feeling of weariness is taking possession of him\nand anyone who likes could overpower him. Instead,\nhe\u2019s constantly looking round, scrutinizing them all one\nafter the other just as a chess player scrutinizes his\nopponent\u2019s pieces as he fights to keep them at bay. They\nkeep their distance because they respect his wounds,\nbecause one ought to have more respect for a dying man\nthan a living one; but Tim thinks it\u2019s his fierce glare\nthat\u2019s holding them off, and the moment they overstep a\ncertain mark, the moment they come one inch too close,\nhis arms start twitching and his hands clench to form\nfists.\n\nHe\u2019s still dazed following the attack and he thinks\nthey hate him because they were all passengers and\nsince he\u2019s the only one of the crew to survive, he\u2019s taken\non the captain\u2019s responsibility for the catastrophe. He\u2019s\nnot even sure any more which one of them flung him to\n\n223\n", "the ground, his last recollections are completely over-\nshadowed by the giant iguanas as they hurtle down upon\nhim like thunderbolts and burrow down deep into his\nagony. Nor can he remember who rescued him. He\nthinks they all deserted him and he managed to drag\nhimself down the cliff face all by himself only to\ncollapse with exhaustion on the beach, and he\u2019s just\ngrateful they didn\u2019t take advantage of the situation in\norder to get rid of him.\n\nThey approach the screaming girl cautiously from\nthree directions: from up the beach and from out of the\nwater on either side of her. It\u2019s as if they\u2019re carrying a\nbird-trapper\u2019s net between them in order to capture her\nscreams and they\u2019re all taking the same short, stealthy\nsteps, no matter whether they\u2019re edging out into the\nwater or tip-toeing over the sand. And all the time the\nscreams are pouring out of her, without a pause, as if all\nher dams had suddenly burst and all her pent-up screams\nwere cascading forth in one rush. Now and then a word\ntumbles out like a scrap of bark tossing about in the\nraging torrent, but before anyone can catch its meaning,\nit\u2019s been dragged down by the eddies and disappeared.\nShe\u2019s lying on her stomach in the water and her head is\nsmothered in wet sand and as they get nearer she starts\ncrawling out of the water like an iguana, with her\nbreast and stomach pressed hard against the sand. Her\nscreams subside into a shrill whimpering and then she\u2019s\njust sobbing loudly and steadily as she starts taking away\nthe stones holding down the canvas sheet over the\nboxer\u2019s dead body.\n\nBut she doesn\u2019t manage to see him: as many as there\u2019s\nroom for fling themselves upon her and drag her away\ntowards the fire, she\u2019s kicking and screaming \u2014 oh, those\nscreams are so horrible they all want to start screaming\n\n224\n", "- and the sand and the water come showering all round\nher and cool them all down, for the heat is starting now\nand steam is rising from the boxer\u2019s canvas and the reek\nof his death spreads slowly over them like a parachute.\nThen she breaks loose and runs stark naked into the\nwater up to her waist and Lucas Egmont wants to shout\nand warn her about the big, dangerous fish at the\nbottom of the lagoon, but then she stops and turns\nslowly to face them and they can see her white body\nglistening through the water like white marble through\na torrent of green rain. She stands there motionless,\nlooking down at her feet, two small white fish sleeping\nbelly-up on the bottom, and just for a moment the\nwhole world stands still. Behind her silent head lies the\ncalm ocean, a single, eternal wave arches its way over\nthe horizon only to be swallowed up swiftly by the\nsilence of the sea and it seems to one of them as if she\u2019s\nleaning back against the thin line of the horizon, so\nbeautiful is the backward curve of her body.\n\nThen she raises her arms out of the water and rubs off\nthe sand, muttering half-aloud, \u201cLet him come to me, let\nhim come tome...\u2019\n\nBut they don\u2019t let him go to her, no matter how\nentreatingly she pleads. They stand guard round the\ndead man, their fingers turning white from the painful\nstrain of holding back a scream. They glance quickly\nround, sizing each other up and down as the hot sweat\nstarts trickling down their bodies, and everything\ngrows harder to bear for the ones that aren\u2019t in the\nwater: the heat is now suspended over their heads like a\nheavy, heavy extra-cranium and their pulse suddenly\nstarts running wild, it\u2019s like being locked in a sauna with\nthe heat getting more and more intense until in the end\n-you're crawling around on the floor, moaning, and\n\n225\n", "begging for the most absurd of rescues: please let the\nearth open up beneath us so the sauna collapses and we\ncan get away from this fiendish heat.\n\nOh, if only the English girl would start screaming\nagain, if only there would be some violent explosion\nwhich would get them out of this awful predicament \u2014\nbut all that happens is that the girl cups her hands and\nquietly proceeds to pour water over her breasts and all\nthe time she keeps on repeating in a nagging monotone,\n\u2018Let him come to me, let him come to me.\u201d\n\nThen she stops pouring and comes a few paces closer\nand suddenly she starts dancing in the water, at times\nher body is completely submerged and they can see her\nlegs pedalling away with short, painful movements\nwhile her arms rise and fall like the skirts of a jellyfish\nand then her dazzling shoulders leap up and she soars\nhigh over the horizon before sinking back down into the\ngreenness like a silken sheet. It\u2019s a dance of desire, a\ndance of desire which would hate to be satisfied, a\ndesire for oblivion.\n\nThen Madame finds the English girl\u2019s cloth on the\nsands and she flings it over her shoulder and she runs\naway from the stench, the heat, the men whose horrible\nsmell of manhood she has only just become aware of;\nshe\u2019s shaking with shame and bitterness, having just\nrealized how horribly naked she herself has become\nthanks to the naked girl\u2019s obscene dance: the mad girl is\nexposing both of them to the lustful stares from the\nbeach - and Madame grabs hold of her by the shoulder\nand stops her in mid-leap. They glare at each other like\ntwo people confronting each other on the lonely rope\nbetween terror and hatred and there\u2019s nothing for it but\nfor one of them to fall. Madame shields her with the\n\n226\n", "cloth as they approach the beach and then she says\ndisdainfully, \u201cAre you on your way to your lover now?\nIs this how he wants you?\u2019\n\nThe English girl punches her right between the eyes\nwith her hard knuckles, and as she butts Madame in the\nback and tries to bite her, she yells at her, \u2018You\nkilled him, that\u2019s what you did. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t\nknow. Just wait till it gets dark, just wait till it gets\ndark.\u2019\n\n\u2018Is he dead? Is your lover dead?\u2019 asks Madame in mild\nsurprise, holding her at arm\u2019s length. \u201cThat can\u2019t be\ntrue, my dear.\u2019\n\nAnd she lifts the girl\u2019s hand and lets it glide over the\nthree angry red bites on her shoulder. And the hand is\nsurprised and then the hand is filled with hatred and one\nof those standing on the beach feels painfully moved by\nthe gesture of ice-cold fury described by the hand as it\nslumps down to her hip.\n\n4\nAs they don\u2019t have any spades nor anything else they can\ndig with and moreover the sand is too hard for their\nnails to cope with, they have to carry out the burial by\nfetching wet sand from the bottom of the lagoon and\nspreading it over the dead body. They work for a large\npart of the hottest period around noon and make no\nattempt to hurry, except at first when the stench is so\nawful, but then they bury their terror, with the kind of\ncalm, sweeping, convincing gestures you make when\nyou're frightened, under four layers of wet sand which\nsoon hardens in the heat. They dig away with their\nhands quite close to the shore but at different places\n\n227\n", "along the beach and all the time the burial is taking\nplace they hardly ever look at one another. Sometimes\nthey arrive at the corpse simultaneously and then they\nget down on their knees side by side and their hands\ntouch as, full of devotion, they spread the new, soft sand\nover the old, hard surface.\n\nBut no matter how much sand they carry under the\nhot midday sun, they cannot bury their fear along with\nthe corpse. Even if they had a whole desert, the vast\nSahara Desert or one of Mongolia\u2019s deserts, they may\nnot have had enough sand. One of them wishes they\nhad a train, a little train with lots of deep wagons, like\nthe train that used to run from the claypit to the\nbrickworks back home when he was so little that\neverything was an animal and the train was the biggest\nanimal he\u2019d ever seen. If only they'd had that train and\nthe wagons heaped up with sand! He could have run\nfrom one wagon to the next with the biggest spade the\nparish had to offer and emptied them just as they were\nclanking past a boxer lying dead by the side of the\ntrack.\n\nAnother of them is walking in the desert. The sun is\nblazing down from a sky as empty and relentless as the\nwhite of an eye. Nothing but sand all around, all the\nsand in the world is spread round about him and he is the\nshifting centre in this ocean of sand, for no matter\nwhere he goes, the centre goes with him. There\u2019s no end\nand no beginning, no up and no down, no forward and\nno backward. The world\u2019s clock has stopped and God is\nbusy with a lit de parade on some other planet far, far\naway. The sun has also stood still, and now it\u2019s going to\nburn away until it melts: that\u2019s the challenge it\u2019s taken\non. And everywhere, nothing but sand. You've stripped\nnaked and lain down on your back in the sand, and the\n\n228\n", "sand is millions, milliards of little animals that have\nbeen asleep for ages but if the sun blazes down as\nfiendishly as this for just a few more hours \u2014 no, there\u2019s\nno such thing as time! - as few hundred paces forwards\nand backwards and round and in a square until they\nwake up and they\u2019re raving when they wake up and all\nthey want to do is to grab hold of this swine who has\ndisturbed their sleep - \u2018and in order to reach the sun\nthey climb up on me, the lonely wanderer in the desert,\nbut then eventually when they realize they\u2019re wasting\ntheir time they'll turn their fury on me and creep into all\nmy grottoes, over the bridge of my tongue, into the\nsewers of my nose, through the mineshafts of my ears,\nand into my eyes, the things I\u2019d like to have preserved\ntill last so that in the least false moment of annihilation I\ncould establish that all my hopes of salvation were just\nas naive as I'd always thought, and they\u2019d bore their tiny\nlittle holes into the middle of my pupils and then trickle\nin through them, curious about the marvels they were\nbound to find behind such beautiful membranes \u2014 but\nGod only knows how disappointed they'll be, oh, how\ndisappointed they'll be\u2019.\n\nBut of course, like all the rest, the man walking\nthrough the desert is just as keen as all the rest on\npreserving his fragile life and is prepared to sacrifice\nanything, even his life, in order to preserve it. He wants\nto create a shadow, a big, deep shadow like the one cast\nby the chestnut trees of summer, and armed with that\nshadow he'll traverse as much of the desert as anybody\nmanages to traverse in a normal life, and he\u2019ll bend\nunder the shadow like an all-too-small cross \u2014 let\u2019s face\nit, there are pitiful little crosses that bend under the\npeople carrying them ~ in the vain hope that the shadow\nit casts will be so soothing, the slumbering creature of\n\n229\n", "the desert will not be wakened unto life until he himself\nhas passed away, since \u2018if anything, I regard it as a basic\nhuman right, perhaps the most basic human right, to\nchoose the manner in which one dies. In a way, I think it\nwas more humane in the old days when some people at\nleast could be executed by the sword. As for me, I\u2019d like\nto be crucified, crucified in a desert like this one,\nprovided the cross could cast enough of a shadow, cold\nenough to keep the animals of the sand in check until I\u2019d\nmanaged to die. But somebody will say you can\u2019t\ncrucify an innocent man, assuming you can talk about\nabstract concepts like a crucifixion when there are so\nmany concrete alternatives, and I reckon it\u2019s obvious\nyou can\u2019t, but it all depends on the fact that my attitude\nto innocence is quite different from that of lots of other\npeople\u2019s.\n\n\u2018I think that being innocent means that either you\nhaven't been born, or you\u2019re dead, and once anybody\nhas got as far as agreeing with that, I\u2019d probably be\nprepared to admit there are many kinds of guilt: a sort\nof guilt that\u2019s more innocent than most, and a sort of\nguilt that\u2019s more burdened with guilt than any other,\nguilt positively dripping with guilt, and guilt which\nmerely drips. Many people can\u2019t see that, they can\u2019t\nunderstand that, they\u2019ll never have the faintest idea of\nwhat it\u2019s all about, they'll just go to sleep by the fire and\nthey'll have forgotten all about it by the time they wake\nup and are overcome by the heat and all they can yearn\nfor is a shapely woman, a juicy orange, a glass of sweet\nwine, a better class of toothbrush, or nothing at all.\n\n\u2018But for me, wandering through the sands of the\ndesert, always having been wandering through the\nsands of the desert, and at last aware of the fact that I\nshall die in the sands of the desert, all that is no longer\n\n230\n", "hard to understand; but it\u2019s true that it\u2019s only just\nrecently even I've begun to catch on, once upona time |\ntoo hada fire to sleep by \u2014 I was lying when I claimed I'd\nalways been wandering through the desert, that\u2019s\nsomething which must have happened to me quite\nrecently, in fact \u2014 but the difference between me and\nlots of the others was that when I woke up, I was so cold\nI was shivering and my teeth were chattering and I\nhadn\u2019t the slightest yearning for any of the usual things,\nthe things you ought to be yearning for if you're\nnormal. Butas I lay there freezing and agonizing, I kept\nthinking after a while that I too had a yearning, that\neven I wanted something, just like all the others, but at\nthat time I was so frightened of not being normal that I\nnever dared to put it into words \u2014 but now that I\u2019m\nfinally wandering through the desert and nobody but\nme can hear my confused words, I can say it however\nmany times | like.\n\n\u2018Lyearned for the deepest feeling of peace there is, a\npeace that passeth all normal understanding, not the\npeace of the tranquil creek, not the peace of the fishing\nrod, not the peace of the bank after closing time, not the\npeace of the cellar when the rest of the house is asleep,\nno, a peace which can only be found in innocent\nsolitude, the peace of a lonely man who hasn\u2019t forsaken\nanyone in order to be lonely, a lonely man who stands\napart from all contexts of blood and suffering without\nanyone being able to pin any responsibility for that on\nhim. And maybe I was aware even then that there was\none place on earth, that there was a desert somewhere\nor other where that kind of peace is possible, or rather\nthat there\u2019s a place in that desert, not a banal oasis, oh\nno, on the contrary: a place which is sandier, hotter,\nmore unbearable than any other in this sandy, hot and\n\n231\n", "already inherently unbearable desert, and if I haven\u2019t\nyet found that place, I\u2019m still wandering around looking\nfor it and if I don\u2019t find it even though I think I\u2019ve got\ndown and stuck my nose into every hollow there is\namong the sand dunes - well, gentlemen, in that case I\nwould beg to be crucified, in that case I\u2019m guiltier than\nanyone else, guiltier not because I\u2019ve acted more\nunjustly than anyone else, but because my self-reproach,\nmy feelings of guilt and my part in so much suffering\nhad a higher temperature than those of anyone else.\n\u2018Being guilty is feeling guilt, not the result of crimes\ncommitted; being innocent is being happy and joyful\nand not letting one\u2019s peace and contentment be affected\nby all the terrible things that happen and take place. In\nmy view, therefore, the judicial system has gone off\ncourse when they execute the less guilty instead of the\nmore guilty, execute the criminals instead of those who\nfeel they are bearing the guilt of the whole world in\ntheir hearts. It\u2019s like executing children for things\nthey\u2019ve done in the dark because they were so un-\naccustomed to the darkness, they couldn\u2019t understand\nhow their bodies functioned in it. No, as the only\ncriminals are those who feel that they've committed\ncriminal acts, the judicial system responsible for\ntracking down and passing sentence on criminals could\nbe abolished and replaced by a judicial system which\nexecutes those who deserve it, since after a while\nthere\u2019s nothing a guilt-laden person desires more than\nto be allowed to die, to be allowed to die because of his\nguilt and that of the world, and he hasn\u2019t the slightest\ndoubt, nor the slightest fear of death, for as there's\nnothing more to hope for, as he\u2019s plumbed the very\ndepths of the world, he can beg the judicial system to\ngrant him his sentence of death \u2014 and no head will ever\n232\n", "bow down before the guillotine more gracefully than\nhis, no woman has ever felt her most precious necklace\ncaress her neck with more ecstatic tenderness than he\nfeels as the rope settles around his neck.\n\n\u201cMyself, I wanta cross. I'll take the storeman with me\nto the warehouse and pick out the most attractive one, I\nmight choose one made of chestnut, because I\u2019ve always\nliked the deep gentle shade of the chestnut, or maybe\none made of poplar, since there was a tall poplar in one\nof the back yards where we used to live and I loved that\ntree as if it had been the only piece of greenery in the\nwhole world, but there is one tree I don\u2019t want and that\u2019s\nthe one which creaks like a gallows when the wind\nblows, and I'll ask the storeman what kind of a tree it is\nbecause I don\u2019t want a cross that creaks like a gallows\nwhen it\u2019s a crucifixion I\u2019ve asked for. I don\u2019t want any\nhelp with the nails and I don\u2019t want any help with\ncarrying it, I want to be my own executioner right to\nthe very last and if there is one thing I want at the very\nend it\u2019s that the shadow cast by my cross is so big and so\ndeep that the animals of the sand don\u2019t wake up until it\u2019s\nall over.\u2019\n\nBut the sun is always devising new games for anyone\nwho wanders through the sands of the desert. Some-\ntimes it puts a blow-pipe to its lips and amuses itself by\nspurting glowing lava into your bone marrow till you\ncollapse and wriggle on the sand like a snake. No, like a\nworm, like a maggot, you can feel the angler\u2019s brutal\nfinger and then suddenly he sticks the hook into your\nbelly and he can\u2019t have heard you screaming because the\nhook just goes further and further in and it\u2019s hot and it\u2019s\nglowing red hot and it hurts especially much when it\ngoes on up through your throat and one of the barbs has\ngot stuck there and is struggling desperately to break\n\n233\n", "loose because the hook has to keep on going, right up\ninto your head, it\u2019s just longing to bathe in your brain,\nit\u2019s probably been lying on its side in a box at the\nironmonger\u2019s thinking of nothing else but the prospect\nof bathing in some human being\u2019s brain. But then comes\nthe most brutal twist of all, it feels as if your legs are\nbeing ripped off - and nothing is too incredible, too\nhorrible, too impossible to endure; of course, your legs\nhave in fact been ripped off, let\u2019s face it, you can\u2019t\nexpect to be left alone no matter how long you are and\nthe angler can use your legs next time, and all of a\nsudden there you are in the sand, you struggle, you\nwriggle around as much as you can, but you can\u2019t do all\nthat much about it, you ought to have practised\nwriggling more often while you still had the chance, but\nin the end you give up because there\u2019s no point and you\njust let yourself sink down and the sand closes in over\nyou like flames and you keep on sinking further and\nfurther: your heart has to go under, your neck has to go\nunder, the whole of your head has to go under and then\nyou go deeper and deeper down, deeper towards the\nultimate horror, the hottest fire - and you just wish you\nstill had your legs left so that you could feel your way,\nso that it would have taken a little bit longer between\nthe first touch and the terrible knowledge which\nsuddenly flares up in you about what\u2019s lying there\nhidden under twenty-five feet of sand. But as things are,\nas things are your nerve ends hit him straight away and\nyour scream comes all of a horrifying sudden \u2014 oh, if\nonly there were another three feet to go, just another\nthree feet of bone, flesh and sinew to cope with that first\nhorrific contact, you evil devil of an angler, do you\nrealize what you're doing! - and you scream and scream\nand suddenly of course you\u2019re full of sand like a sack.\n234\n", "Sand everywhere, sand sand sand, the sand is darkness\nand light, the whole of your head is full of sand now that\neverything else has trickled out, sand is rattling away in\nyour intestines and your stupid stomach is doing its best\nto digest it all, but even so the sand doesn\u2019t help you to\nget away from your terror, get away from the horrific\nawareness of what that devilish angler let his bait rest\non. Shudder after shudder of terror stutters through\nyour sandself and they follow the twists and turns of the\nhook as faithfully as anyone could ask. It\u2019s so horrible,\nperhaps the most horrific thing of all, to hit directly\nagainst a dead body with your nerve ends \u2014 you want to\nexplode, you want to be blown to pieces, but sand is so\nmerciless in that it can\u2019t explode no matter how hot and\nagitated it gets, no matter how wildly and how long you\nscream at it that it really must get a grip on itself and\nblow itself into the skies, but sand is so scornful and so\nunreceptive to flattery or warnings, and just to show\nyou what it can do twenty-five feet under the surface, if\nit is that deep, it creeps close up to you and starts\ntickling you for all it\u2019s worth, and you can\u2019t even laugh.\n\nThen at last comes the signal from up above, there\u2019s a\nslight tug on the hook, and you do all you can to make\nsure you don\u2019t come loose from it, oh you dear little\nhook, your sand thinks, don\u2019t abandon me now. And the\nhook doesn\u2019t abandon you, you're pulled up, relent-\nlessly up, and you bless the hook for being so strong. But\nthen you're suddenly hit by that horrific moment when\nyou realize you're not alone, that you're not the only\none on the way up, that the booty the angler had been\nhoping for so much is also on its way up, clinging fast to\nyour nerve ends as if on to a rope and the dead man\nwon't let go even though you start wriggling more and\nmore violently and your nerves don\u2019t snap even though\n\n235\n", "you wish they would with all the heat of your sand. And\nthen daylight at last, daylight at last, you're not\nwriggling any more, you just hang limply while the\nsand runs out of you without anything else coming in to\nreplace it apart from pain. Your legs are lying in the\nsand underneath you and they must be dead, they\u2019re not\nmoving in any case but your feet are clamped fast into\nthe sand, possibly out of despair and because they\u2019re\nlonging for a trunk.\n\nThen the horrific thing that\u2019s followed you up comes\nloose and the angler laughs so much he sprays you with\nred-hot saliva and he kicks it and it responds with a dull\nclang - and before your eyes fall down into the sand,\nweary from having seen so much pain, you manage to\nmake out that it\u2019s a water keg, quite a big, green water\nkeg, there\u2019s nothing else to say about it, but perhaps\nthere must have been something wrong with it even so\nbecause suddenly the angler kicks into shape a big hole\nin the sand and he pushes the water keg into it until it\ndisappears, yelling and screaming all the while. And\nwhat happens next is just that the sun swells up like a\nred-hot toad and finally explodes and turns into\nballoons, millions, perhaps even milliards of balloons,\nall of them glowing just as terrifyingly red-hot as they\nsink slowly down over your desert and merely increase\nthe heat of the earth and you're just glad that you don\u2019t\nhave legs any more to feel the heat with, and the\nballoons come nearer and nearer and suddenly there\u2019s\nan enormous crush as all the millions and milliards of\nthem are just as keen as the next one to fall into your\neyes \u2014 and all at once, in a single singeing stabbing\nmoment they all join up with their heat and the whole\ndesert trembles and the angler falls into his hole and the\nwater keg goes up in smoke and your eyelids quake till\n\n236\n", "they shatter in the horrific cascade of blinding light and\nall-consuming heat which is now pouring over the earth\nand over you yourself.\n\nAnd when Madame and the English girl return from\ntheir secret excursion to the inland part of the island and\none of the three men sitting in the shadow of the cliff,\ntheir hands and arms covered in dried grey sand,\nsuddenly remembers how full of hatred a hand was as it\nmoved down against a hip, they stop in surprise at the\nsight of the two low sandhills that have appeared on the\nbeach.\n\n\u201cHe got a decent burial, nobody can deny that,\u2019 says\nTim Solider, and he\u2019s forgotten all about keeping his\ndistance now that so many horrible things are behind\nthem.\n\n\u201cHe passed away from us so quickly,\u2019 says the captain,\nanybody would think he\u2019d got sunstroke, he\u2019d stopped\nwalking over to the boxer, and all the sand he carried he\njust flung over the emptied water keg, it was as if he\nwere even less able to bear the sight of that than of the\ndead body. He worked like a slave to get it covered up\nand in the end he was crawling on all fours between the\ntank and the water with sand in his hands, and when we\ntried to help him up he squirmed like a snake and kept\nyelling that we ought to let him go because he was just\nas dead as we were, he just yelled. Anybody would\nthink he was the one who'd done it, nobody knows any\nmore, knows nothing, knows nothing about that.\n\nThen Madame goes up to Lucas Egmont who's lying\noutstretched like a gravestone on the grave over the\nwater keg and his body is all limp when she tries to lift\nhim up.\n\n\u201cWe ought to try and get him into the shade at least,\u2019\nshe says. It\u2019s just then she notices the white rock, and she\n\n237\n", "lets him slump back on to the sand and wades out into\nthe water and bends down and strokes it, for under the\nsand they have carried away to make the graves is a\nshimmering white rock, but none of them had noticed.\n\n\u201cYou must have been blind,\u2019 she says, brushing the\nsand off it, \u2018you must have been blind as bats.\u2019\n\nShe\u2019s no idea how blind they are.\n\n5\n\nThe white rock is quite different from what they had\nfirst thought. They imagine it starts at the spot where\nMadame discovered it and then runs out towards the\nmiddle of the lagoon, covered with a thin layer of sand;\nbut when they scrape away the sand with their weary\nhands, they find it takes off in a quite different and\nunexpected direction, and suddenly they\u2019re all possessed\nby a powerful, compulsive desire to uncover the whole\nof the white rock, and to persuade it to reveal its white\nsecrets. Indeed, they're all so keen to get to work that\nthey kneel down in the water and start digging away the\nsand with urgent movements of the hands.\n\nIt\u2019s already less hot than it was and the water in the\nlagoon is motionless. There\u2019s a slight breeze higher up\nand they can hear the panicles of the grass rustling, a\nsingle iguana is falling from one stone to another, and\nalthough the sea is so near it sounds as though it\u2019s in the\nfar distance, swishing like an invisible waterfall from a\npoint beyond the horizon. The closest noise is Lucas\nEgmont\u2019s voice as he talks in his sleep. They\u2019ve put him\nin the shade next to the cliff, and he\u2019s still asleep, lying\non his stomach, and convinced he\u2019s on the water keg\u2019s\ngrave; from time to time he says, quite clearly: I want to\n\n238\n", "be crucified, and he seems to be groaning with happiness.\n\nThere are five of them kneeling in the water, digging,\nand they\u2019re working so doggedly, so self-sufficiently, as\nif what\u2019s lying hidden under the coarse sand is the soul\nof the world, the solution to the riddle of earthly\nsuffering, and they\u2019ve forgotten about everything else\napart from this warm, shallow water and this sand which\nis still hot when it fills their cupped hands, and the white\nrock whose whiteness grows more and more dazzling\nthe closer to land its nakedness shines upon them.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve forgotten everything else, in fact: little\nmouse, says the grey cat of fear, little mouse, go and run\naround in the grass for a while, forget my mouth, forget\nmy claws, let the sharp, white teeth hovering over you\nbe swallowed up by the twilight. Little mouse, dear\nlittle mouse, let me stop torturing you for five minutes\nor twelve minutes or two hours or three days, run as far\nas you have time for, run as far as you can manage, run\nas far as you dare! Run through the clear night whose\nbrightest stars are my eyes, they'll light you up for as\nlong as you deserve, run through the dewy morning and\ndon\u2019t worry about who\u2019s forcing the grass apart just\nbehind you, run through the long, sunny day and seek\noblivion in my merciful shadow which is following you\nall day long, just as faithfully as your own! And never\ncomplain about the loyalty of fear, little mouse, but do\nso occasionally about your own disloyalty whose only\nexcuse is that it won\u2019t last any longer than I let it.\n\nThey\u2019re working away now lustily and energetically,\nas if they were digging a canal leading to their rescue;\nthey\u2019ve stopped using their hands as they\u2019re not efficient\nenough, the rock goes down deeper the closer it gets to\nland, and the captain is scooping sand with his jackboot\nwhile Boy Larus and Tim Solider are using their canvas\n\n239\n", "shoes, which means they have two tools each and in\norder to make the work go more quickly \u2014 needless to\nsay they hope the rock will prove to be endless and\nthey'll still be working away stubbornly when the\nliberator comes with his teeth and claws \u2014 the women\u2019s\njob is to empty the filled receptacles in the deeper water\nbeyond the far tip of the rock, and a circular membrane\nof sand rests like a blind eye on the placid surface of the\nlagoon and this eye is the only happy eye on the whole\nisland. They can\u2019t see the shadowy ruins of the stranded\nship which has sunk to the bottom of the lagoon, nor the\ngraves on the beach over two hopes which no one had\nexpected anything of and which are therefore mourned\nall the more deeply, nor the fire which is slowly going\nout because no one has felt cold for such a long time, nor\nthe images of terror which keep on flitting like bats\nacross their field of vision, images of what each of them\nfears most grinning scornfully down at them even\nthough they persist in gazing down at the sand and the\nwater.\n\nSuddenly the rock rises up quite steeply, just at the\npoint where land and water meet, and at the same time\nit gets thinner and shoots off almost at right angles and\nabout three feet across, towards the cliff; it\u2019s only a few\ninches into the sand now, so shallow that everyone\u2019s\nsurprised they haven\u2019t stumbled over it at some time\nduring the few days they\u2019ve been on the island. The\nwomen come up from out of the water and stand behind\nthe men and gaze down on their naked backs, burnt\nbrown by the sun and glistening as hard as an iguana\nskin, and the men\u2019s hands are working like pistons as\nthey brush away the sand which is steaming in the heat,\nand the rock emerges more dazzlingly white and clearer\n\n240\n", "and smoother and more polished than ever, like a\nwoman\u2019s back.\n\nBut as mercilessly as any destiny you like, the rock\nheads straight for the buried water keg and they hesitate\njust for a second, although you couldn\u2019t notice any\nchange in their mechanical movements, before opening\nup the grave. The sand is hard packed and steam is rising\njust a little from its dampness and then they can feel the\nkeg under their fingers and they roll it to one side with\nan enormous heave until it comes to a halt splishing and\nsplashing in the shallow water at the edge of the beach.\nAfter just a few more seconds they've removed all trace\nof Lucas Egmont\u2019s work and they've barely finished\nwhen they realize it was all in vain as the rock suddenly\ncomes to an end, quite pointlessly, like when you check\none movement in order to make another one which is\njust as pointless; it\u2019s grown tired of creeping any further\nup the beach, maybe it thought the island was too awful\nfor a little white rock to rest on but then it couldn\u2019t be\nbothered to crawl back again as the bottom of the sea\nwasn't much better either.\n\nIt\u2019s an awful moment when the rock comes to an end:\nthey\u2019ve been ejected from a horrific existence, with no\nhope of rescue, it\u2019s true, but obscured by forgetfulness,\nand thrust into a horrific existence with no hope of\nrescue where the only certainty is pointed awareness;\nand as they kneel there with their necks bent over the\nopened grave, their backs reflect their terrified in-\ndecision in so comical and so frightening a fashion that\nthe women observing them from above first want to\nroar with laughter and then scream in fear.\n\nCover your backs up, we don\u2019t need mirrors any\nmore is what Madame wants to shout to them, cover\nyourselves with sand, cover yourselves with ashes and\n\n241\n", "clothes and let\u2019s see your terror in your hard faces\ninstead, it\u2019s much purer there, it won't frighten us there\nso much, not any more, we won't need to see how awful\nwe look when we can\u2019t control ourselves any longer,\nwhen we've spread ourselves to prepare for the first bit\nof terror that comes our way; but just then the English\ngirl grabs hold of her arm just above her elbow, so hard\nit turns white, and with her free hand, the same hand\nthat\u2019s been stiff with hatred for three hours now, she\npoints quickly at one of the backs on the beach and\nMadame notices straight away the little red teeth marks\non its right shoulder-blade, and she glances up at the\nEnglish girl and sees how clearly her mouth remembers\nits bite of hatred and her tongue the taste of blood from\nthe previous night, and from this mouth and this hand\nwhich drops down to her hip once more she can see\nwhat is soon going to happen, the inevitable that can\u2019t\nbe prevented just as you can\u2019t stop an avalanche by\nstanding in its way, and he\u2019s burnt by their gaze and\nturns his head round quickly and spits a glance over his\nshoulder and straight away he\u2019s just as hideously aware\nof it, for when he turns his head back again and looks\ndown at the sand, his shoulder is trembling something\nawful.\n\nThen they don\u2019t really know what to do: they all\nwalk down to the water\u2019s edge and roll the keg out into\ndeeper water and let it fill up slowly and when they roll\nit back over the rock it makes a dull, heavy clanging\nnoise and it\u2019s only when they get it back to the little\ncrown that they realize fully how sadistic they\u2019re being\ntowards themselves. Oh, how will they be able to open\nthe tap and let the water rinse away the last grains of\nsand from the rock without remembering those\nmarvellous moments of blissful coolness when a handful\n\n242\n", "of water trickled down their throats and then continued\nto spread coolness through all the canals of their bodies?\nThen someone shuts his eyes and quickly as an axeman\nhe turns on the tap so that the water starts cascading\ndown the rock, making it still whiter, making it sparkle\nlike a jewel of salt and mother of pearl - but the\nthirstiest of them all, who was still hoping desperately\nthat the last drop of drinking water which might have\nstill been there at the bottom of the keg could possibly\nbe still there on the rock, flings himself down headlong\nand starts licking the rock and he licks it all from top to\nbottom until he vomits from all the salt and starts\ncrying, starts crying salt tears which he can\u2019t drink\neither. And he\u2019s terribly ashamed when he gets up again\nand with a gesture of simulated defiance kicks the\nempty keg over the beach, down the rock, and before it\nstarts floating it clanks away so piercingly and\nfrighteningly that Lucas Egmont wakes up and sits up\nwith a start - and immediately realizes what's\nhappening.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing with my water keg?\u2019 he yells,\n\u201cWhy have you dug up my water keg, how dare you!\u2019\n\nThey stare at him with the empty, ruthless gaze of a\nstatue, and he casts down his eyes.\n\n\u201cWhy did you do it?\u2019 says Madame, though like the\nrest of them she knows it doesn\u2019t matter any more, \u2018why\ndid you pour away our water?\u2019\n\nThen he remembers his dream and then he remembers\nall the moments of guilty horror when all the world\u2019s\nprosecutors marched up to him in order to make him\nanswer for everything that happened through no fault\nof his own, and bitterly furious and offended at being\naccused of such a petty matter he first looks round and\nthen starts yelling once more: \u2018What about the fire,\n\n243\n", "then ? Why did you let the fire go out? And the food!\nWhy did you eat the food? What\u2019s the use of water\nwithout food? And what\u2019s the use of food and water if\nthere\u2019s no boat to take us away from here? And what\u2019s\nthe use of a boat coming to rescue us if we don\u2019t want to\nbe rescued, if we're all refugees who have come to the\nonly no man\u2019s land where we belong!\u2019\n\nAfter a while somebody says, \u2018Have a look at this\nrock we\u2019ve found.\u2019\n\nAnd everybody stands looking at the sparkling white\nrock and it\u2019s much less hot again, the sun is setting\nextremely slowly but they can sense that it\u2019s falling\nslowly down towards the tongue of the horizon; slowly\nand just as frighteningly pointless as the truth, the sea is\nmoving in on the island in hundred-yard breakers, and,\nhowling lazily, the wind rises and falls between the sea\nand the sky on that extremely beautiful day in May in\nthe southern, northern, eastern or western hemisphere.\nOh, how indifferent fear and death are to our geo-\ngraphical situation.\n\nThen Lucas Egmont says, \u2018What do we want a rock\nfor? What are we supposed to do with a rock? Is it a\nrock we need? For God\u2019s sake!\u2019\n\nBut perhaps it is.\n\n6\nYes, what does anybody want a rock for? Can anybody\nsay what you\u2019re supposed to do with a little white rock\nabout nine square yards in size, and with half of it under\nwater come to that? Is there anything more pointless\nthan a little rock, in fact, that you can\u2019t bore holes in and\n244\n", "then blow up and extract some meaning from, some\nsensible meaning?\n\nThey've sat down round it on the sand and they\u2019re\nthinking and pondering, sitting there quietly and feeling\nfor one horrific moment God\u2019s or somebody else\u2019s hand\nswishing through the silence of the bathroom and taking\nout the plug from the bottom of the bathtub and the\nsucking feeling as their life begins to run away is like a\npunctured artery somewhere in their bodies. But it was\nonly a test after all, the plug is back firmly in place and\nthe hand is as motionless as a fly on the ceiling - and\nlook! The cat of fear has once again let its little mouse\ngo, and constantly shaded by its enormous shadow,\nthey\u2019re all running away through the grass of the world.\nLittle mouse, the cat whispers disdainfully, little mouse,\ndon\u2019t forsake me.\n\nThey sit thinking about all the little white rocks\nthey've come across during their lives, but there aren\u2019t\nmany of them, there\u2019s been a distinct shortage of white\nrocks in their lives, and the English girl doesn\u2019t even\nremember the white cliffs of Dover because she\u2019s so\nbusy thinking about that other business.\n\n\u201cBack home,\u2019 says Tim Solider after all too long a\nsilence, and the bits of rag that have grown into his\niguana bites are flapping in the breeze, they\u2019re stinking\nalready, \u2018in the square back home there was a statue the\nsame colour as this rock and we used to call it the ghost,\nbecause it was so white. Especially in the moonlight it\nlooked as though it was luminous, quite luminous. It\nseemed as if somebody had given it a coat of phosphorus,\nbut they hadn't.\u2019\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t very well make a statue out of this rock,\u2019\nsays the captain morosely, brushing the sand off his\njackboot, \u2018and even if we could, what'd be the point, it\n\n245\n", "would be a waste of effort here where nobody will ever\nsee it.\u2019\n\n\u2018You're forgetting the birds, captain, and the\niguanas,\u2019 says Lucas Egmont, who\u2019s suddenly got such a\nburning desire to burst out laughing, he\u2019d really like to\nlie outstretched on the ground, all alone with the sun\nand the cloud, and just roar with laughter, make fun of\nthe ridiculous lunacy which makes six people already\ncondemned to death, six people who have already got\nused to the hard padding of the electric chair, six people\nwho have already got a thin, sharp line straight across\nthe back of their necks because they\u2019ve so often felt the\naxe tickling them, negotiating over a rock, worrying\nabout how a useless bit of rock flung out at random\nsomewhere or other in the world should be used.\nPointless indeed, so pointless, so disgustingly pointless \u2014\nbut as he sits there looking down at the rock, he notices\nhow the silence has suddenly become loaded with\nhostility, and all at once he realizes he\u2019s hurt all of them\nby what he\u2019s said, and he glances cautiously at them all\nin turn without letting go of his eyes and he realizes\nfrom the seriousness creeping into their expressions that\nthe rock is a sacrament as far as some of them are\nconcerned, the only firm foundation, the only fixed\npoint in this world that\u2019s rotating so madly. Peter \u2014 the\nrock. Maybe it\u2019s Peter who\u2019s turned into a rock and is\noffering his back to them as a firm foundation.\n\n\u201cWould it really be as pointless as all that to make a\nstatue?\u2019 he says, therefore. \u201cWe could draw lots to\ndecide who would be the model and then make one,\nalways assuming of course that we had the chisels and\nsledge hammers and drills and crowbars necessary to\nenable us to break off a big enough piece, and it might\n\n246\n", "only be enough for a bust come to that, assuming there\u2019s\na sculptor among us.\u2019\n\n\u2018It would be meaningless in any case,\u2019 says the\ncaptain, \u2018since nobody would ever come here no matter\nwhat. There\u2019s no point in leaving a statue for the birds\nand the iguanas, as you just said.\u2019\n\nAn icy silence ensues, freezing the air round about\nthem, and their thoughts hang like stiff clouds of smoke\nfrom their mouths, even though it\u2019s at least eighty in the\nshade, and snares of hoar-frost tighten round everyone\u2019s\nneck \u2014 but there\u2019s an unspoken word, an as yet\nunformulated truth or lie which could redeem them all,\nat least for a few moments. And Lucas Egmont has a\ncompletely new experience: without being the slightest\nbit interested, not even for a moment, since he doesn\u2019t\nneed to feel thirsty just now, in the kind of salvation\nwhich needs a rock in order to be realized, indeed,\nwithout being especially interested for a single moment\nin salvation in any shape or form, since he\u2019s convinced\nor at any rate posits that the only thing which could\nmake a human being seek a way out of the jungle that is\nthis world is total, clearly acknowledged awareness\nthat no salvation is possible on the grounds that a jungle\nis a jungle is a brutal jungle, that is, without having any\nsympathy at all for the hunger or salvation shining forth\nfrom the eyes of several others here present, he\nsuddenly feels an irresistible desire to express the\nblessed opinion which everyone except the captain -\nthat man with his perverted ideas about solitude \u2014 is\nlonging to hear, he wants to be a medium, an anti-\nspiritualist medium, and suddenly he discovers the\nenemy that is his and everyone else\u2019s. He leans over\ntowards the captain and glares short-sightedly, and\nanyone who can\u2019t detect the animosity in this gaze must\n\n247\n", "have been blind for a hundred years, it\u2019s like staring at\nan old suit of armour where four hundred years of\nsolitude stare at you from under the rusty visor, while\nthe memories of the knight\u2019s hate-filled eyes during the\nbattle are still glinting in the eye-slits.\n\nOh, captain, he thinks, what an old suit of armour\nyou are, what an old, empty suit of armour. All your life\nyou've been going around like a suit of armour without\na knight. Someone wanted to stroke your brow and you\nsaid: One moment, I'll just lower my visor; someone\nwanted to feel your heart beating, and you replied\nscornfully: you'll need a sword for that, and someone\nfetched a sword and thrust it through you and it just\ncame out of the back-plate without doing you any harm\nat all, well, maybe it would rain in through the hole, but\nthat\u2019s not much of a risk as rain doesn\u2019t often fall\nhorizontally when all\u2019s said and done. You couldn\u2019t\nbleed because suits of armour have some trouble in\ndoing that and you were proud of it and you were happy\nto be an empty suit of armour, since empty suits of\narmour have such a good time: they\u2019re lonely and\nthey'll always be so, and in their solitude empty suits of\narmour can hear all the singing inside them and round\nabout them. Old hunting horns are tooting away, and\nthe ancient cries of falconers, long since forgotten, are\nonce more echoing through the air and suddenly the\nwhole suit of armour is filled with the noises that used to\nbe heard in the days when the armour was alive, in the\ndays when the armour was full of life, of flesh that could\nbleed, of limbs that could writhe in agony, of rattles and\nscreams of terror, and the shrieks and the old noises rise\nand fall through the empty suit of armour and there is\nsuch a marvellous singing and vibrating inside it. It has\nno heart, you see, it can only feel vibrations as if they\n\n248\n", "were wonderfully beautiful music, and it misses out\ncompletely on all the angst in them, the fear of death and\nthe hatred of life: there\u2019s nothing more stupid than the\nsolitude of an empty suit of armour.\n\nBut above all it\u2019s through your severe eyeslits,\ncaptain, that we can see you're proud of being an empty\nsuit of armour; an empty suit of armour can\u2019t be afraid,\nfor instance, it can wander through any forest you like\nwithout being worried, without being afraid that a\nsnake might wriggle up through the heather and wrap\nitself around its leg. You think it\u2019s an advantage, an\nenormous advantage not to be able to feel afraid, and in\nyour emptiness you are laughing away at all the many\npeople who are terrified at the prospect of dying of\nhunger, dying of thirst, dying of loneliness, dying of\nparalysis, dying of wounds, but if you pause and think\nabout it then maybe it\u2019s not as much of an advantage as\nyou think. Your lack of fear isn\u2019t in fact due to your\nstore of courage, but rather to your inability to feel\nanything at all, to your not being able to feel anything\nbecause you haven\u2019t had anything to feel with for the\nlast four hundred years, and your memories of the time\nwhen the armour was bristling with life just fill you\nwith ridicule and sterile defiance.\n\nThat\u2019s why it\u2019s right to say to you what someone once\nsaid to somebody else: I say unto you, the man who fears\nnot life shall not love life, the man who does not harbour\nfear, neither shall he harbour courage, the man who\nfears not death shall not be enabled to die with dignity,\nthe man who fears not himself, neither shall he love\nanother. But let\u2019s not talk about that, captain, you can\u2019t\nbe opened up with words, you can only be opened up\nwith a tin opener or a five-inch nail, and when you have\n\n249\n", "been opened up, people will only wonder why they\nbothered.\n\nPerhaps the suit of armour heard what he\u2019s been\nthinking, for suddenly the captain looks him in the eye,\nthrusts his gaze into Lucas Egmont\u2019s eye like a lance and\nbreaks it and leaves it sticking there and suddenly\nthey're united by a warm current of animosity. Lucas\nEgmont would like to sit close up to him and clutch his\narm and his hands and thank him for giving him his\nanimosity. After all, it\u2019s so comforting to know one has\na steadfast enemy in this vacillating world. And\neventually, the next minute or in an hour\u2019s time or some\ntime before darkness falls, they'll face up to each other\nand they both feel that strange feeling of dull gratitude\nand fear that grips you just before a terrible con-\nfrontation.\n\nBut it was a medium he wanted to be, an anti-\nspiritualist medium for all the others, for the salvation-\nseekers who still didn\u2019t know where their enemy was,\nand that\u2019s why he wanted to defeat the captain first,\nreally flatten him, on behalf of the others.\n\nThere\u2019s a while to go yet before dusk, and far away to\nthe west clouds are being sprayed in through a hole in\nthe horizon like puffs of steam. Somebody suddenly gets\nthe idea it\u2019s the smoke from a steam ship cruising\ntowards the island, and gazes at the spot where the\nblack funnel will first appear like a periscope, but the\nclouds just keep on rising and turn into mountains and\nthen even bigger mountains and all hope is dashed.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s as meaningless as you think,\ncaptain,\u2019 says Lucas Egmont. \u2018You say it\u2019s pointless to\nmake that statue just because nobody will see it when\nit\u2019s ready, always assuming of course we really could\nmake a statute, but I can\u2019t believe it would be as\n\n250\n", "pointless as that, even if the situation is so awful that no\nboat will ever go past and be attracted to the island by\nthe wreck. The way you think, the way you argue,\nanybody who\u2019s alone would never be able to act at all\njust because he knows that nobody else in the world will\never get to know about it, and so anybody who\u2019s alone\nought to be completely paralysed and think he might\njust as well put an end to such a meaningless existence.\u2019\n\n\u2018That\u2019s exactly what I do think,\u2019 said the captain,\nwith a hint of hostility, \u2018that\u2019s my way of looking at it\nexactly. Life is completely meaningless for a solitary\nperson, in fact, and he would die, might just as well die\nas you put it, if it weren\u2019t for one thing, if he didn\u2019t have\none thing to live for, namely: his solitude. It\u2019s in order to\nbe able to make the most of that solitude he chooses to\nstay here for a while and carry out all the meaningless\nacts life demands of him. Great and formless meaning-\nlessness, that\u2019s the price of a ticket to solitude.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut in that case,\u2019 counters Lucas Egmont, \u2018I don\u2019t see\nwhy you object so much to the meaningless nature of\nthe statue. To dedicate a statue to solitude is surely no\nmore pointless than, for instance, opening a gate even\nthough there are so many gates open already, or\nbuilding a road to add to the many unnecessary ones that\nexist already.\u2019\n\n\u2018For the solitary person,\u2019 replies the captain, pulling\noff his boot with a sigh and placing it on his knee, \u2018for\nthe solitary person there\u2019s only one kind of permissible\nmeaninglessness, and that\u2019s the kind of meaningless acts\nwhich help him to achieve his solitude, and there are\nmany impermissible, indeed forbidden meaningless\nacts, and the most meaningless of all these meaningless\nacts are of course the ones which take him back to any\n\n251\n", "kind of threatening, all-consuming, inexhaustible\nfellowship.\u2019\n\n\u2018But there\u2019s something there which doesn\u2019t hold\nwater,\u2019 Lucas Egmont points out. \u201cYou maintain that\neverything we do in this life is meaningless, but on the\nother hand you claim that in so far as you're a solitary,\nlife actually has a meaning, and that is, solitude for its\nown sake. But solitude which can be compared with a\nblissful existence in a combined snake pit and concert\nhall, this state doesn\u2019t just take possession of you for no\nreason, it\u2019s no good just lying down in a basement and\nwaiting for it to come over you from out of the\ndarkness; oh no, the most craved-for demands the most\npositive action on your part, demands that you should\nplay a positive role in what you called the meaning-\nlessness of the world \u2014 but that\u2019s where I think you make\na big, terminological error. In so far as they assure you\nof the meaning of life, unshakeable solitude, it can\u2019t\nreally be true that these actions are as meaningless as all\nthat, not for you that is; in fact they\u2019re on the contrary\nvery important and meaningful actions, and it seems to\nme what you should be drawing distinctions between is\nnot meaningless and very meaningless actions, but\nmeaningful and meaningless actions. Although you\u2019re\nso keen to deny it, therefore, there are meaningful\nactions even for you, just as in my view there are others\nfor whom there are meaningful actions in life, even if\nlife itself is meaningless. Of course, no doubt there\u2019s\nnothing here which is meaningful in itself, or we'd\nnever be able to forgive life; but everything we do and\neverything we have done is surely meaningful for\nourselves, for our own feelings of fear, for our own\nfeelings of guilt. Hence action, ridiculous, meaningless,\nparadoxical action, is so full of meaning, so weighed\n", "down with responsibility even for the many of us who\nare longing for fellowship but wandering around as\nisolated as heavenly bodies in space which is growing\nmore barren for every pulse-beat that passes. That\u2019s\nwhy one has to carve one\u2019s bit out of the world\u2019s\nmeaninglessness and confess before one puts the knife\nbetween one\u2019s teeth for good: I believe in the meaning-\nless nature of the whole, but the unintentional\nmeaningful nature of the part.\n\n\u201cAnd since we've got a rock,\u2019 he goes on, and they all\nstand up and look down at this white rock, this white,\nvirginal back which has become so endlessly white by\ndint of having spent a few hundred thousand years\nwaiting for the sun, \u2018since we've got a rock, it\u2019s\npointless not to use it, but extremely pointless to do\nanything with it. There can be no question of a statue, of\ncourse, as, apart from anything else, we don\u2019t have the\nnecessary tools; but we should be able to do something\nelse. You can carve things into a rock, for instance.\nThere are white rocks that, with a bit of effort, you can\nscratch black or green lines on to if you use sharp\nenough stones.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat should we carve into it?\u2019 asked the captain\ncaustically. \u2018That there were seven of us to start with,\nbut that one of us died more or less straight away\nbecause we thought he smelt so awful, we couldn\u2019t bear\nto do anything about his illness and get him on his feet -\na little arrow pointing to his grave \u2014 and that somebody\nelse murdered us by means of emptying our drinking\nwater, and that a third one served us up with glass beads\nwhen we were at our hungriest, saying, here you are,\neat these.\u2019\n\nThen Tim Solider gives a yell and he runs at the\ncaptain with his hands clenched pathetically over his\n\n253\n", "iguana wounds like the heroes in old melodramas.\n\n\u2018Shut your gob, will you! Shut up!\u2019\n\nHe stands opposite him, panting, and his wounds\nsuddenly start bleeding and two little streams trickle\nslowly down towards his navel where they join and\npause briefly and, throwing caution to the winds, he\nhurls himself violently at the captain, but of course he\nfalls to the ground, falls right on to the rock, knees first.\nThe captain helps him up and Tim is so weak again he\nhasn\u2019t the strength to do anything but hold on to the\nhated hands stretched out towards him.\n\nThen the captain whips round with a nastily powerful\nmovement, the brutal turn of a soldier, and faces Lucas\nEgmont and the visor falls open in the empty suit of\narmour but the hatred sparkles forth through the\nnarrow eye-holes like the beams from a lighthouse and\nas he stands there with his back-plates glittering with\nhostile solitude and the copper shield at his chest\nbeautifully curved by its longing for a lance, he says so\nfirmly and decisively that everyone can tell he\u2019s made\nup his mind long beforehand, perhaps even before they\nfound the rock, perhaps even before the catastrophe\ntook place, perhaps even as he was trembling at the very\nstart of his solitude: \u201cWe'll carve a lion.\u2019\n\n\u2018A lion?\u2019 says Lucas Egmont. \u2018Who can remember\nwhat a lion looks like? It\u2019d be better to do an iguana.\u2019\n\nBut Madame remembers what a lion looks like.\nThere\u2019s a tree swaying in the breeze over the lion cage\nat Bretano\u2019s zoo and an escaped monkey\u2019s sitting in the\ntree, trembling with cold and despair; people bring a\nlong ladder and she points up at the brown monkey and\nsays to the boy that monkeys are dangerous, especially\nones that have escaped; they can swing down out of the\ntree and split your head open before you know where\n\n254\n", "you are; but the boy isn\u2019t scared, he just looks as\nuncomprehending as usual, just as bereft of humanity,\nand in despair she drags him over to the lions\u2019 cage.\nLook, she whispers, look at the lions, you can\u2019t believe\nhow dangerous they are, look how soft their paws are so\nthey can slink around, you can\u2019t hear a sound, you might\nthink they\u2019re the nicest animals in the world - and then\nsuddenly there\u2019s a terrifying growl and a roar of anger\nas they fling themselves at the bars, do you see how\nthick they are, you only need to annoy them the\nslightest little bit and they hurl themselves at you and\ntry and tear you to bits. Just stick your arm in through\nthe bars, and you'll see, that\u2019s it, further, a lot further.\nBut nothing happens, nothing at all, except that the\nbiggest lion lies down in the middle of the cage and\nmeets her wild eyes with its bleak gaze. Look at me, she\nsays then to the boy and he pulls his arm slowly back,\nlook at me; and she wants to scream when she sees his\neyes, no lion can call them to life, no hungry, roaring\nlion can touch his soul. Does it ever happen, she says\nexcitedly to the keeper as he climbs down the ladder\nwith the trembling monkey clutched tightly to his\nchest, does it ever happen that a lion tries to escape?\nNever happens, answers the keeper like an echo, never\nhappens. Like an echo.\n\nThen the captain holds his jackboot up in the air so\nthat everybody can see its shiny leather and he taps it\nwith his hand just above the heel and when they all get\nnear enough they can see the big lion emblem burnt into\nthe leather.\n\n\u2018There we can see what a lion looks like,\u2019 he says. \u2018Is\nthere any animal with such a simple outline as a lion?\u2019\n\n\u201cIt would be just as good to take an iguana,\u2019 maintains\nLucas Egmont, \u2018iguanas are also very easy. There\u2019s one\n\n255\n", "lying just down there: we could bring it here, remove its\nskin, and just press it into the rock.\u2019\n\n\u2018I think the lion\u2019s better,\u2019 says the captain, \u2018and\nthere's something special about this particular lion even\nthough it\u2019s just a simple trademark lion. If you look\nreally closely\u2019 \u2014 and everybody looks really closely, but\nthey don\u2019t notice at first even so \u2014 \u2018you'll see the lion\nisn\u2019t sitting on the ground or in the air; the lion\u2019s sitting\non a human being, on a freshly killed human being, and\nyou can see from his stiff outline how surprised he is\nsuddenly not to be alive any more. I\u2019ve sat round many a\ncamp fire and never ceased to be astonished at this\ntrademark, at this painfully honest trademark, the lion\u2019s\nvibrating solitude after slaying his last enemy, the only\none to bar his way to solitude.\u2019\n\n\u2018Captain,\u2019 Lucas Egmont suddenly shouts out, \u2018you\nsurely don\u2019t mean we should also include that detail on\nyour sadistic trademark. It\u2019s quite enough with just a\nlion.\u2019\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s not difficult in the least, I can assure you of\nthat, there\u2019s hardly anything easier to draw than a\nfreshly killed human being. There\u2019s more of a firm\noutline than ever before, a monumental simplicity and\nclarity of contour which has always pleased and\nsurprised me, and it\u2019s often made me feel pain when I\nthink that all that beauty, that delicious purity will soon\nbe lost forever without having been captured by the\nhand of an artist. Therefore I have to say I felt\nextremely attracted to this trademark, no matter how\nsadistic you might think I am, and of course we shall\nhave this man on the rock as well, since that\u2019s what\ngives the picture its meaning, it interprets our situation\nso absolutely splendidly. Of course, there aren\u2019t any\nlions on this island, if there were we'd certainly have\n\n256\n", "heard them before now; but what there is here, for\ninstance, is a silence, a silence so hideously ancient that\nevery little tiny hole in it, even a hole as tiny as the one\nwe've made during the four or five days we\u2019ve been\nhere, is such a terrible deed that once the perpetrators\ngrasp the full extent of what they've done, they have no\nchoice but to be horrified and try to obliterate all trace\nof their crime by taking the fastest possible steps to\ndeprive themselves of any possibility of disturbing this\nsilence in future, and in the end the silence weighs down\nupon our breasts with all the weight of its lion\u2019s body,\nalone at last, alone again at long last - and everybody\nwho comes here and finds the rock is bound to think:\nwhat courage, what heroic courage, accepting one\u2019s\nsolitude voluntarily and without the slightest quiver, by\nbaring one\u2019s breast to the claws of the lion!\u2019\n\nThen Lucas Egmont cries out in desperation, \u2018Is there\nanyone else who wants to commit suicide? Anybody\nelse who wants to carve a dead body under the lion?\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 says Boy Larus.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 says Madame.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 says the English girl.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t know,\u2019 says Tim Solider.\n\n\u2018In that case,\u2019 says the captain, \u2018I suggest we all go for\na stroll round the island, and meanwhile think about\nwhat we want to do. We can assemble here again at\ndusk.\u2019\n\nBut as they are on their way up the cliff, several of\nthem turn and gaze down for quite a while at the beach\nwith its graves, one of them desecrated and one not yet\ndesecrated, its footmarks suggesting madmen have been\ndancing along the water line, its little grey hollow\nwhere a fire once burned, the battered ship leaning\n\n_ tight down over the lagoon as if to drink, the ocean as\n", "blue and indifferent as the sky and the silence, and the\ntall strand of smoke from the vessel of their longing,\nwhich has engraved itself deep and indelible into the\nsky, a chink in the door to eternity; they stand there\ngazing for such a long time before continuing on their\nway up to the grass and the solitude, as if they would\nnever return.\n7\nThere\u2019s a point ina person\u2019s life which exists so as not to\nbe intruded upon. It\u2019s like a little, blue mountain peak\nwhich, bluer and sharper than the darkness, shoots up\nout of the darkness, and an invisible lighthouse which\nonly operates occasionally during your lifetime and\nthen for the shortest of times flings out a serpentine\nbeam of dazzling light into the night, illuminating it for\none dizzy second \u2014 just one second, but that\u2019s enough.\nThe darkness itself seems to be cloven by a terrible wall\nof light and you\u2019re drawn implacably towards it like a\nmoth and then suddenly it\u2019s all over: the light goes out,\nbut it\u2019s still burning on your retina and with eyes\nburning with light, you grope your way forward to a\nparticular spot whose existence you've only suspected\nbefore, ready for anything, ready to come up against\nboth salvation and destruction, the whole truth or the\nwhole lie. And fumbling through the darkness but with\ndeep wounds of light, you fling your arms around that\nlittle mountain peak, that fortress of ruthlessness,\nwhere everything hounded, cast aside, silenced clings\non like a leech, and you become nothing more than a\ngiant leech sucked hard against the mountain, while\neverything you believed was prescribed bites on to\n258\n", "the nipples of your terror. Nothing is prescribed,\nnothing can be prescribed: not a thought, not an action,\nnot a word; that\u2019s the terrible thing about living as you\ndo, without fear in a darkness which you think is\ndefinitive but which is really just a respite before the\nlighthouse flares up. Just think how much you wish\nyou'd been blind, so that you could have been spared\nthis final light as well, this light which is so terrible\nbecause its ruthless edge cuts through even the most\ntightly shut of eyelids - and as you end up lying there in\nthe night clamped to your blue stone and being\nbreastfed by all the forgotten horrors, you'd scream if\nyou weren\u2019t the leech you are: why only now, why\ndidn\u2019t I come this way before, why didn\u2019t I take the\nstrokes I needed to swim into range of this invisible\nlighthouse? I knew all the time where it was and how\nthe little mountain peak lay in wait, crouching like an\nanimal, enticing with its claws and its leeches which\nonly grew more savage the more time passed by. I've\nknown about this for a long time, but I relied on flight as\nbeing the most crafty deceit of all; but as I was running\naway I was constantly aware of certain signposts whose\nenamel had been chipped away by flying stones, of\ncertain snakeskins which had been nailed fast to the\nroad by heavy vehicles, of certain glowworms crushed\nby some mad fury and piled up by the roadside, and\nhence knew I was getting closer and closer to the\nhorrors. Then suddenly it was too late: one is transfixed\nby the violent shaft of light and in the darkness is a blue\nvortex which knows no mercy.\n\nThere\u2019s something in the very air which rouses her\nand she awakes witha start and looks round quickly and\nsuspiciously \u2014 but she\u2019s alone. There are still rustling\n\n- sounds in the thickets and the grass: someone is slinking\n259\n", "or running in towards the middle of the island, but after\na while it\u2019s probably just the wind through the tops of\nthe grass. Even so, she stays there for a while yet, her\ngaze flitting like a grieving dog backwards and forwards\nalong the thin strip of sand, punctuated by steep cliffs.\nShe\u2019s stood here before and gazed down at the beach,\nbut it\u2019s always been different, always been alive, and\nnever has it been so narrow. It looks as if the water has\nstarted to rise slowly, slowly but absolutely inevitably,\ndetermined to creep up the island and lick off all the\ndryness, all the desert dryness the water is thirsting for.\nBut then her gaze is stopped short at the burnt-out fire\nand the dead, singed hollow is just as far from the\nwater's edge as ever it was and a remarkable, a strange\nblue deepening of the air, a tall, narrow shadow\npointing straight up into the sky above the fireplace still\nreminds her of the smoke that once was the stuff that\nhopes were built on, and the acrid smell of unwillingly\nburning wood still tickles her face when she closes her\neyes. She could wake up after dreaming about a burning\nhouse with pale faces darting about behind the window\npanes cracked by the heat, without ever wanting to save\nthem; but she borrowed a pair of binoculars from the\nchief fire officer and saw they were in fact balloons\nwith faces painted on to them, jerking about on their\nstrings in an effort to break loose, but they always burst\nwith a loud bang and she would wake up from the\ncrackling sounds in the fire. Good God, is it the fire\nthat makes the beach so horribly deserted, so horribly\ndead?\n\nThe graves are also there, the water keg is bobbing\nsecurely against the beach, and there are the lines she\nmade in the sand, the sharply outlined furrows in the\nsand she used to flee to when she wanted to be alone.\n\n260\n", "Then, at that very moment, her gaze wrenches itself\naway from her will and makes a mad leap out into the\nwater, a leap throbbing with fear and despair. It races\nthrough the water, setting spray flying, then launches\ninto a fast crawl across the lagoon and suddenly is about\nto dive underneath a floating object when the white\nthing flings itself at the bold swimmer and blinds it, first\nwith pain and then with mad terror, then with\noverwhelming relief.\n\nIt\u2019s not the boy who has been thrown over the reef by\nthe waves and is now drifting closer and closer to the\nshore, it\u2019s something else, something quite different,\nand her gaze returns to the white rock in a calm, smooth\nbreast-stroke. The sun gradually turns red with poppies,\nand she remembers the lion, and is just about to turn and\nhead for the grass and start thinking about such an easy\nproblem and then return as the sun dips sizzling into the\nsea and all is well, when all of a sudden her gaze leaps up\nthe cliff and something forgotten, something long since\nforgotten but lying crushed far below hurls itself upon\nher gaze, and it\u2019s bleeding when she drags it away and\nruns along the red curve of the rocky path and the high\nhigh bushes close over her and she suddenly notices the\nsmell as it slips a disgusting hood over her head, but she\ndoesn\u2019t stop even so, she has no time to stop.\n\nShe\u2019s surprised at being so alone; the world is emptied\nof all voices and suddenly the world is emptied of all\nsound. Dripping from all her wounds, she falls down in\nthe grass but even then she doesn\u2019t want to stop, she\nkicks all around her in desperation but feels she\u2019s only\nsinking deeper and deeper down into the still-hot earth,\nthe hard earth which is no longer alive, having been\nstunned by the sun and killed by the grass. There she\n\n-lies, silent and still, listening to the silence; but she\n261\n", "daren\u2019t, can\u2019t listen for long for fear her eardrums will\nbe burst by this highly charged silence.\n\nAnd the smell is still after her, creeping like a\ncaterpillar down the long grass stems, and at first,\nalmost without any fear at all, she tastes it and tries to\nrecall this smell. It\u2019s the sort of smell you might find ina\ncellar, it\u2019s a smell which requires you to go down many\nflights of stairs with a bunch of keys rattling from your\nfinger, then you open a door, many doors, the last of\nthem heavy monsters of doors you have to heave against\nwith your shoulder before they slide open, creaking and\nsquealing. This is a smell for the dark, for cellars, or for\nsome other dark places. It needs a lamp, an insignificant\nflashlamp projecting its frightened glances into every\ncorner of the darkness and only succeeding in making\nthe darkness even more frightening and the smell even\nmore mysterious. It\u2019s a smell for felt soles, the sort you\ntake long strides with when you're running around in\nwet grass so that the damp won't go through them and\nbecause you're frightened of snakes. It\u2019s a smell that has\nto be overcome by stealth, a smell you must hurl\nyourself at and fight with for a while, bite, and fling\nyour arms round to crush it. It\u2019s a smell that requires\nyou to go right into the cellar and put the flashight\ndown on the floor so that it just surrounds itself with a\nlittle hazy circle of light which doesn\u2019t even reach as far\nup as the dripping stone ceiling. Then there are things to\nbe shifted out of the way: firewood, heavy crates with\nthe lids nailed down, keeping mum about what\u2019s in\nthem, odds and ends of fishing tackle with wet seaweed\nstill clinging to them, lots of cracked croquet balls,\nsacks, empty but tightly knotted sacks of coarse\nmaterial that rattles - sand, maybe? - when you move\nthem, the odd axe gone rusty because it\u2019s been left out in\n\n262\n", "the rain and nobody\u2019s bothered about it, and perhaps the\nmisshapen skeleton of an old iron cot which still seems\nto tremble when you lift it up in the air, tremble because\nit belonged to a child that recently died of tuberculosis.\nYou pile all these things up behind you to make a barrier\nand it\u2019s so high you can hardly imagine there\u2019s a light\nbehind it and as you stand there enclosed by four walls\nof darkness and a ceiling of darkness and a floor of\ndarkness you suddenly realize there\u2019s a smell of fear as\nwell, a smell that makes you search all over the cellar\nfor a pickaxe, shaking all the time, and when you find\none you start bashing away at the floor behind the\nbarricade, carefully at first so that only cracks appear in\nthe concrete, but then more and more violently,\nincreasingly afraid of all kinds of things: of the people in\nthe house waking up and failing to understand what it\u2019s\nall about, of finding that looking for the smell under the\ncellar floor is a waste of time, or that the outcome is as\nawful as you\u2019re already imagining it will be.\n\nBut it\u2019s only when she\u2019s groping her way through the\ngrass again, almost closing her eyes because of her\ndesire to be able to go past the thing that\u2019s waiting for\nher, only when she stumbles against the dead iguana\ndoes she realize what a cruel fate lies in store for her.\nShe goes down on her knees beside the stinking iguana\nand at first she wants to yell out: that\u2019s not it, that\u2019s not\nmy iguana, somebody else has killed this one: but the\noutline of the stone in the rotten green mass still retains\nits horrific sharpness, and her lips are burning with the\nmemory of kissing the iguana\u2019s skin and the sound, the\nhorrible wet, sticky sound of the stone embedding itself\nin its belly starts vibrating devilishly slowly in the air\nround about her and the fatal stone\u2019s heavy fall down on\nto the rocks on the beach suddenly starts echoing and\n\n263\n", "the echo darts piercingly from one wall to another\nthroughout the room that\u2019s the world and forces her\ndown closer and closer to the iguana - oh, how she\nstruggles to protect her mouth!\n\nAnd then she\u2019s running again, for she\u2019s come up again\ndespite everything, it\u2019s even possible to emerge from\nthis, and as she runs, she\u2019s rubbing her lips all the time\nwith the back of her hand, but her lips are just as dry and\nchapped as always and there are no bits of rotting\niguana stuck to them. Feeling calmer, she slows down,\nbut the smell catches up with her again, screws itself on\nto her, is intimate with her, presses itself against her\nface like an anaesthetist\u2019s mask. She forces herself to\nthink clearly and calmly, to make a decision which\nwon't drive her into a state of lamentable panic. After\nhaving walked for quite a way through the grass,\nwalking calmly and with strides as confident as one can\nmanage when one\u2019s scared, after having gone in a\nparticular direction and with all her senses on edge to\nensure that she doesn\u2019t deviate from this safe route and\ncome to a part of the island that\u2019s unfamiliar to her as\nyet, after having noticed the smell gradually dispersing\nand wafting away and just hanging on in the grass\naround her like a dim memory, she stops and wraps her\narms round the grass in front of her and pulls it down\nover her. Then, hidden by the grass, she gets undressed\nand lies down stark naked beneath it. It\u2019s so dark down\nthere, a reddening haze is crawling along the ground\nand she realizes it can\u2019t be long to sunset, she can see the\nwhite rock glistening with solitude when she closes her\neyes, and she keeps them closed for a long time and\nallows herself to be soothed by the stifling warmth\nrising up from the ground. It\u2019s so nice to be naked in the\ngrass, and sleep comes creeping up on her, all she has to\n\n264\n", "do is to reach out for it and pull it towards her. The\nmoment before she falls asleep, she has a dim re-\ncollection of the lion and the white rock, but it\u2019s so far\naway, so pointlessly far away, that she just lets it sink\nout of sight. What are you supposed to do with a white\nrock when you can forget everything even so?\n\nShe doesn\u2019t sleep for long, however. In actual fact,\nshe starts waking up straight away. It\u2019s a dream she\ndreams and wakes up from, and there is a big, fiery\nyellow carpet with a green border and she\u2019s walking\nslowly over it down an endless corridor. She\u2019s been\nplaced somewhere in the middle of the corridor and\nisn\u2019t allowed to turn round and see how far she is from\nthe end and now she\u2019s walking very fast and she\u2019s glad\nthe carpet is muffling her rapid footsteps. A vast\nnumber of doors open out on to the corridor, all of them\nwith frosted glass in their upper half, and it strikes her\nthat none of them is thrust open by scurrying people,\nnor is there a sound to be heard behind any of them and\neven so she feels she is far from being alone. She stops\noutside one of these doors and examines it through her\nshoe. It\u2019s funny: there\u2019s a hole in her shoe sole, quite a\nbig hole, but instead of having it resoled someone has\nput a piece of glass in the hole, a powerful magnifying\nglass, and she\u2019s examining the door through it. Nothing\nat all escapes her attention, she notices fingerprints on\nthe yellow handle and she takes out her handkerchief\nand rubs them away; the glass panel in the door has\ncobwebs in the corners, and she blows them away with\na careful puff. Then she notices something quite new\nabout the door: it has a name plate, an enamel name\nplate in line with the handle. But the plate is caked in\nthick dirt which can only be scraped away with sharp\n\n265\n", "nails. She dreams she\u2019s scraping letters out of the dirt,\nand then she drops her shoe in surprise and it shatters\nwith a loud crack even though it did fall on the carpet,\nand it\u2019s that noise she wakes up from.\n\nThere\u2019s somebody standing in the grass beside her,\nswaying back and forth on the soles of his feet; it\u2019s aman\nand he has his back turned towards her and he\u2019s\nwhistling softly, as if to a dog. Without looking round,\nhe throws a little twig over his shoulder and it falls quite\nclose to her and after a while he throws the next bit of\nthe newly broken twig in the same direction. He\u2019s\nwaiting for somebody, and is indulging in pointless\nactivities to pass the time. She\u2019s looking at him from\nsuch an unusual angle and is so nervous that she doesn\u2019t\nrecognize him at first, but all of a sudden he pulls off his\nshirt and rubs his bare back with it and the shiny little\nred wound on his right shoulder blade immediately\ngives him away.\n\nIt\u2019s grown redder and angrier since she saw it last, or\nmaybe it\u2019s just the slowly encroaching twilight that\nmakes it glow something awful, she thinks it looks like a\nlittle cruel, greedy and sensuous mouth busy trying to\nbite its way further and further into his body. Then he\nstops whistling, then he stops breaking off twigs, then\nhe stops rubbing himself with his shirt, he drags it\nquickly back on over his head and then stands still\nand in silence as he waits for the person who's now\napproaching.\n\nSomeone is running through the grass and panting\nhard, and all at once the English girl is standing so close\nto her that Madame could grab hold of her ankle, pull\nher over to her through the grass and beg her to refrain,\nplead with her to have mercy on the doomed man,\n\n266\n", "indeed, even cling on to her so that nothing could\nhappen.\n\nBut everything has to happen, there are courses of\nevents one just can\u2019t interfere with because they\u2019re so\ndevilishly logical, so inaccessible to one\u2019s efforts, that it\nsuddenly seems meaningless for anybody to exist at all\nwith free will, human reason and all the attributes\npeople go on about so much.\n\nThey meet more or less at her feet, and the man leans\nforward towards the English girl and clutches her to\nhimself with a ruthlessly quick movement. They stand\nthere in silence for a minute or so, and it looks as though\nthey are pressed tightly against each other in a clinch,\nbut from behind it\u2019s easy to see from the girl\u2019s tense\nbody that she\u2019s drawing back, that she hates and is\ndisgusted by this contact, one of her shoulders is\ntrembling with fear and reluctance, but the man who is\nresting his chin on her other shoulder doesn\u2019t notice a\nthing. He\u2019s gazing into the grass behind her with a cold\nsmile of triumph and suddenly he lets go of her and\nswings her round as if he were her trainer and he grabs\ntight hold of her trembling shoulder and wants to drag\nher away with him. Then she tears herself loose and falls\ndown on her knees so close to Madame that she\u2019s sure\nshe\u2019s been detected \u2014 but it\u2019s something much worse.\n\n\u201cSomebody\u2019s killed an iguana,\u2019 she says, pointing\ndown at the ground with a piece of grass.\n\n\u201cCome on, it stinks something awful, we can\u2019t hang\naround here, we can\u2019t put up with this smell,\u2019 says the\nman impatiently, pulling her to her feet, and she says it\u2019s\ncruel and horrible and that one of them must have done\nit because this thing has been killed in such a human\nway, and then they disappear into the dusk of the grass\nand the silence of the grass, and Madame is all alone\n\n267\n", "with everything she\u2019s been running away from. And\neverything\u2019s so horrible: she only needs to stretch out\nher hand and the iguana is lying there, sticky and\nstinking, just waiting for her hand, and she tears up\nclumps of grass and rubs her hand clean but that\u2019s not\ngood enough, the horrible stench clings on to her more\nfirmly than ever, and on the plate she'd been scraping\nin her dream was the word iguana, although she'd\nforgotten that until now,\n\nShe has no choice but to flee. She tries to hold her\nbreath but in the end she has to gulp in air and the air is\nfull of the stench of a dead iguana. She runs up towards\nthe highest peak on the island, thinking the wind up\nthere would surely blow away all the unpleasantness in\nthe air, but the higher she gets, the more oppressive it all\nis. As she\u2019s clambering up, she has to keep stopping and\nbreathing in deeply and her lungs are full to bursting\nwith the horrible stuff.\n\nBut high up at the top of a narrow little hill that looks\nlike a shrunken volcano and drops down to an unfamiliar\nbeach with little white rocks glittering in the sand,\nstained pale pink in the sunset, the air is pure at last,\nbitter and thin but pure. She kneels down on the brink of\nthe precipice and watches the empty ocean stretching\nits shivering, glowing sheet over the darkness of the\ndepths, and everything is forgotten. She is alone on her\ncliff and nothing can reach her, so high is she now. It\noccurs to her she could be mistress of the world: it\u2019s so\neasy, all you need is to be alone on a higher peak than\nanyone else.\n\nThen she thinks she can see an iguana creeping along\namong the stones on the beach far below; it\u2019s a little\niguana and its scaly skin is gleaming and it\u2019s crawling\nvery slowly, as if it had been injured or was frightened\n\n268\n", "of something behind a stone. Madame leans forward as\nfar as she dares and spits down at the iguana, but she\nmisses.\n\nI\u2019m not scared any longer, she thinks, iguanas are\nnothing to be afraid of. They only bite men who are\nlying on the ground, and you can fight them, kick them\ndown the cliff if they come too close.\n\nBut just as she\u2019s about to spit again, she sees the big\niguana crouching behind a burning stone by the water\u2019s\nedge, and she thinks she should shout to the little one to\nlook out, to run away as quick as it can, but her tongue\nhas stiffened inside her mouth and there isn't a single\nloose stone up here she can throw down at the lurking\ndanger. And the little iguana is so comical in its\nattempts to escape death, it suddenly changes direction\nand heads straight for the stone where its enemy is\nwaiting, and it\u2019s crawling much faster now. Oh, if only\nshe could throw herself down and save it, but of course,\nit\u2019s all too late. Without making a single move of its\nhead to ensure that death isn\u2019t lying in wait behind the\nnearest stone, it crawls past the burning rock and the big\niguana jumps out at the little one and hurls it against a\nstone so hard that its armour-like skin bursts open and as\nit slithers down the stone twitching with pain and\ndeath, the big iguana burrows mercilessly into the little\none\u2019s belly and all the time the big one\u2019s tail is smashing\ninto the stone on either side of a gap between two rocks\nlike a vicious whip. It\u2019s a horrible noise which drowns\neverything else, drowns her heartbeats, drowns her\nagitated, squeaky breathing, drowns the sea and the\nwhistling wind. But then all is silent and the big iguana,\nsuperior in every languid movement, clambers lazily up\non a dazzlingly white rock, desecrating it with the\ndeath of the little iguana. It lies there motionless on the\n\n269\n", "rock and the sun gleams warmly on its horrible snout,\nand in the shadows below the little one is still gaping in\nsurprise with its belly, and the echo of its tail whipping\nthe stones seems to be echoing still, loud and terrible.\n\nNo, it was a different noise, it is a different noise, it\u2019s\nsomething sharp and distinct coming from just behind\nher, but as yet she\u2019d rather not turn round and face it.\n\nThe lion, she crouches there thinking in desperation,\nstill on her knees, which lion should I choose, the lion\nwhich...\n\n... but suddenly she\u2019s walking down a long staircase,\nglittering in the bright light from the ceiling above, and\nthe stairs rise towards her with their newly polished\ncopper edges and the yellow bannister rail which she\nclings on to with both hands is hot and shaking, as if it\nmight explode at any moment. Everything\u2019s bubbling\naway beneath her, tables are being overturned and\nthere\u2019s creaking and clanking as chairs are crushed to\nbits against the walls. Her legs and thighs have turned to\niron as, in the grip of some ruthless fear, she struggles\ntowards a green rectangle, the beckoning rectangle of\nthe door opening above her \u2014 but then suddenly the\nstaircase has become an escalator and the water grasps\nhold of her ankles and calves with a short, piercing\ngiggle and she sinks down and sinks into the sticky,\noffensively warm water, it clings to her hips, it clutches\nat her breasts, it twists itself round her neck and pours\ninto her mouth, callously and with a shrill sucking\nsound, and into her ears, and her eyes \u2014 and now the\nwhole of her has sunk below the surface of her fear. . .\n\nShe turns round very quickly, she almost flings\nherself round and stands up at the same time, as if to\nscare somebody with her agitation. But the iguanas are\nnot easily scared, the hundred, the thousand, the tens of\n\n270\n", "thousands of iguanas that are spread over the whole of\nthe cliff behind her, and the gap between their snouts\nand the cliff edge starts shrinking and the space she has\nin which to work out her salvation is getting narrower\nand it doesn\u2019t tremble under their armour-plated skins\nwhen she stamps her foot on the rock. They just keep on\ncrawling closer and closer, and the sun which is about to\nset glistens on a gigantic carpet of iguanas, a rolling\ncarpet without a beginning and soon to be without an\nend and already she\u2019s being stifled by the choking stench\nthese million or so iguanas are thrusting towards her.\nShe\u2019s stopped stamping, she\u2019s gone down on her knees\nagain with her face bravely confronting the mass of\niguanas, accepting whatever comes. She can\u2019t run away\nfrom these iguanas that are already dead, she can\u2019t run\nover the top of their armour plating as she would over a\nspiky carpet: she\u2019d be overcome by the stench and fall\nand they\u2019d be on her ina flash; she can\u2019t fight them: once\nroused they\u2019d just surge forward and squash her under\ntheir horrific, stinking weight. The silence is unbearable\nas they creep towards her, all the cracks from their\ntwitching tales have been silenced, the soft scratching\nsound from their scaly skins scraping against each other\nis the only, the last sound of her life.\n\nThen she screams, then she flings herself down before\nthe iguanas and screams as she tries to scratch wounds\ninto the rock, in vain of course, with her nails: \u2018The lion,\nthe lion, I must go to the lion! Let me through, do you\nhear, I have to get past!\u2019\n\nBut the iguanas make no response, they just keep on\ncrawling closer and closer and the ledge is now so\nnarrow that she can\u2019t even lie there with her arms\noutstretched, as if she were swimming; she has to pull\nback the arm she\u2019s stretched out towards the iguanas\n\n271\n", "and roll over closer to the precipice so that her other\narm is already hanging down over the sharp edge, and\nroll even closer and with a desperate thrust, with\nenormous strength born of fear, roll closer still, roll\nover with clenched eyelids and bleeding fingers and a\nhunched body that has already accepted all the horrors\nof the fall and she rolls over the edge and as she falls,\neyes closed and with all her senses numb from terror,\nshe can\u2019t even see that the cliff she\u2019s falling from is just\nas empty as it always was, glittering emptily in the\nsunset which no longer follows her as the shadows close\nin.\n8\n\nI must keep my face nice and friendly, my hands must be\ncalm and amorous and full of longing, she thinks, and\nthen my body mustn\u2019t tremble, and I must sound calm\nand my voice must be sufficiently keen for him not to\nsuspect anything. He might fling his arms round me and\nhug me into his sweat, and if he does I mustn\u2019t vomit,\nnot yet, but I must pretend I\u2019m enjoying it, as if there\u2019s\nnothing I'd like better than him hugging me close, so\nvery close.\n\nJust then he walks past the bush where she\u2019s hiding\nand she calls to him softly so as not to frighten him and\ncautiously takes hold of his arm. When he turns to face\nher and dives into the green, stifling shade under the\nbush there\u2019s a glint of fear in his eyes and she can see the\ntension in his face, and his hesitant movements as he\napproaches her tells her how suspicious he still is.\n\nYou're so scared, she thinks, but she half-closes her\neyes so that they won\u2019t radiate triumph and give her\n\n272\n", "away, you're so scared, you're sweating with fear, your\nshirt is damp and stained, everything about you stinks of\nfear.\n\nSomeone walks past just then, next to the bush where\nthey\u2019re hiding, and she pulls him quickly towards her\nand gently places her hand over his mouth and with a\nsurge of pleasure she feels his tongue tickling her skin.\nThey stand there for a minute or so, hugging tightly,\nboth of them pretending to listen to the rustling noise as\nwhoever it is walks quickly away through the grass; but\nin fact, they're just listening to each other. She can hear\nhis hot breath hissing past her ear, he\u2019s swaying\nbackwards and forwards on his feet and making the\nleaves rustle, and with a strange feeling of excitement\nshe can feel his heart beating hard, hard between her\nbreasts. Then she suddenly lets go of him and takes her\nhand away from his mouth as she kisses him quickly just\nunder his eyes and then the cloth falls away from her\nand she presses her naked body forcefully against his.\nWith a shudder, she feels his horrible hot hands stroke\nher back with eager caresses, he leans back and lets her\nrest on his quivering body and he bites on to her mouth\nlike a leech and his crazy hands have intertwined behind\nher shoulder blades. Just as they're about to fall,\nhowever, she braces herself and whispers vehemently,\n\u2018No, not now, wait, wait, you must wait, you must wait\na minute, just a minute.\u2019\n\nA little branch has come between them and she takes\nhold of the branch and tickles his naked chest with it\nuntil he\u2019s smiling again, and with her other hand she\ncaresses his back tenderly until she finds the little\nhollow made by the bite and her lips remember it and\nthey grow agitated as well and when she bends over the\n\n_branch and bites his lip he just thinks she wants to be\n273\n", "kissed and he strokes her with both hands in the most\ndisgusting way.\n\n\u201cWhen,\u201d he whispers at the same time, and there\u2019s a\nheavy veil over his eyes, as on a drunk, \u2018when shall we\nmeet?\u2019\n\nCarefully, so as not to annoy him, she removes his\nclammy hands from her body and returns them to their\nowner.\n\n\u2018Just as the sun\u2019s setting,\u2019 she says, \u2018the moment the\nsun sets, I'll meet you in the grass below that plateau\nwhere you usually go in the evenings.\u2019\n\nThen he\u2019s back again with his wet mouth and\nsuddenly he\u2019s sucking away at one of her breasts, but she\ncontrols herself, she keeps control until he lets go of her\nand disappears into the high grass with a knowing,\nintimate wink. Then she punches the little branch with\nher clenched fist, punches and punches at the bush until\nshe falls flat on her face with the effort, and lies panting\non her stomach in the deep shadow of the bush.\n\nMaybe she dozes off for a while in the suffocating\ncloseness under the big bush, or maybe she just glides\naway from reality for a moment, for suddenly the pain\nin her back returns, it\u2019s a stabbing pain which cuts into\nher like a knife, a knife being thrust in and pulled out by\nsome inexhaustible hand. Now, as then, she wriggles\nabout in an attempt to get away from it, but there\u2019s no\nrespite, she can\u2019t get away from anything at all, she has\nto go through it all again.\n\nIt\u2019s a hot jungle and a green haze filters through the\nquivering roof of the treetops, tall grass and trembling\nparasols of leaves on slender flagpoles. It\u2019s a wet jungle,\nand where she\u2019s slinking along its floor with tortuous\nsteps there are stinking green pools, covered with green\nmembranes that heave but don\u2019t burst as creatures move\n", "underneath. She\u2019s hot and sweaty in a more unpleasant\nway than ever before, a shameful sort of sticky heat\nwraps itself round her body like a wet bathing costume,\nand in order to be rid of it she flings off all her clothes,\nscrews them up into a rough bundle and hurls them into\na serpentine bush, which lets them sink down whispering\nthrough its hairy branches. But nothing is any better\neven though she is naked, the jungle has a fever and she\nherself is enclosed by the jungle\u2019s fever; the trees\nthemselves are feverish, their crowns whistling in the\nwind and balancing on shaking, sweaty trunks; poison is\ndripping from the parasols, falling down in sizzling\ndrops to the ground, and the ground itself is feverish,\nhot, evil-smelling vapours are rising from it and the\ndirty pools with their green membranes are the ground\u2019s\nwounds.\n\nOh, she\u2019s so frightened of hurting herself, of cutting\nherself on something, and her blood spurting out in a\ngreen spray until the wound is suddenly covered by one\nof those green heaving membranes. She throws herself\ndown before one of the ponds and wallows in her heat,\nthen she breaks a little twig from a bush and, frightened\nbut nevertheless convinced it\u2019s the only thing to do, she\npokes a hole in the skin over the pond and watches in\nhorror as it slowly grows bigger and bigger and an\nanimal or at any rate some living creature wriggles its\nway under the membrane towards the hole. And she\nwants to drop everything and run, drop everything:\ndignity, reason, and every trace of courage and every\ntrace of protection from her fear, and to race pell mell\ninto the redeeming maw of the jungle, but she\u2019s\nincapable of moving, she can\u2019t even raise her eyes and\nlook away, she has just to lie there outstretched by the\npond and watch the animal she\u2019s aroused by poking a\n\n275\n", "hole in its prison come closer and closer and suddenly,\nsuddenly its head emerges unseeing and slowly from the\nwater and wriggles its way forward over the membrane,\nits body comes pouring out of the water, yard by yard,\nthere\u2019s no end to it, and spreads itself over the whole of\nthe membrane, strong enough to bear it all, and at first\nthe snake just lies there motionless, at first the red snake\njust lies there with its eyeless head not moving at all, as\nif surprised by all the new sensations it\u2019s come up\nagainst: the sudden dryness, the heat which is so\ndifferent, and the noises that have lost all their muffled\nquality and are now piercingly shrill.\n\nThey lie there quite still, she and the snake, and she\ncan\u2019t move and wouldn\u2019t want to do so for fear the\nsnake would realize she existed and perhaps chase after\nher or make some other of the jungle\u2019s inhabitants\naware of her existence.\n\nThe hot, damp ground suddenly starts shaking be-\nneath her and the sound of a terrifyingly shrill trumpet\ncuts through time. The snake grows nervous and its long\nbody starts shivering slightly while its eyeless head,\nwith no place for any eyes even, rears up as if listening.\nThere\u2019s a sound of snapping twigs and dry grass\nbreaking quite close by, and suddenly the elephant\ntrumpets again, she turns to look and sees the elephant\nhas come to a halt among a clump of parasols and its red\ntusks gleam ominously, its mighty body is still trembling\nwith a desire to crush everything in range, its little eyes\nare glinting evilly in their little sockets, and suddenly it\nraises its trunk and squirts its thick, red, evil-smelling\njet straight into her eyes.\n\nWhile she\u2019s still blinded, she hears the elephant\ndeparting, crashing through the jungle quite close by\nher, and a little tree falls over right across her back and\n\n276\n", "wounds her superficially with its sharp trunk, and the\nhissing animal gets further and further away and its\ntrumpeting rides off through the jungle with it, while\nshe\u2019s trying to rub her eyes clean, and she feels weak and\nscared as what has happened dawns on her. Then at last\nshe can see again, and the first thing she wants to do is to\nfind some grass so that she can dry her red hands and get\nrid of all the elephant\u2019s fluid, but it\u2019s only when she\nthrows all caution to the wind and sits up with a start\nand looks down in horror at her body that she realizes\nthe whole of her is this same, poisonous red colour, her\nskin has disappeared and her blood has acquired a thin,\nblood-coloured membrane to replace it. Carefully, she\nfeels her body, frightened this membrane will suddenly\nburst, and she feels hotter than ever and more ashamed\nthan ever, something dirty has happened to her,\nsomething which means she\u2019s suddenly got problems\nwhen it comes to staying alive.\n\nThen all of a sudden, with a stab of surprise, she\nnotices how the light of the jungle itself has changed\ncolour, it\u2019s not green any more, like a shower of blood,\nradiantly red, it pours in through the roof of the jungle\nand the earth and all the leaves and the branches and the\nparasol poles are the same colour as she is. A few fiery\nred birds parachute down from some tree or other,\nshrieking shrilly and urgently to each other all the time,\npecking at the air with their beaks; a large animal,\narmadillo-like, is hanging asleep on a branch swaying\ndangerously high above her head: sooner or later it\nmight break, and the animal come crashing straight\ndown on top of her. But even so, she\u2019s not as frightened\nas she was shortly before; she\u2019s taken on the colour of\nthe jungle, and she thinks she\u2019s entitled to the protection\nof the jungle, and so she lies down calmly on her back\n", "beside the pond, its red water is glimmering under the\nbody of the snake and she\u2019s no longer as frightened of\nthe snake as she was, since now she\u2019s so like him, and as\nit glides towards her over the red, shuddering mem-\nbrane, she doesn\u2019t scream, nor does she offer to fend him\noff.\n\nHe trickles up her leg like stiffened water, and the\ncontact she\u2019s dreading is not all that awful but tender,\nticklish, and she even caresses the snake with her red\nfingers and feels how similar they are, both of them are\nblood held together by some silly little membrane, and\nthe snake makes her feel warm, the snake generates\nheat, not unlike her own but more intensive, more\nstupefying, not so shameful because he\u2019s so strong. And\nshe gazes straight up into the red roof of the jungle\nwhere butterflies as big as swallows and with burning\nwings are fluttering around, living lianas that aren\u2019t\nsnakes squirm from branch to branch, giant chameleons\nthrust out their tongues and butterflies get caught by\none wing which then comes loose and they float down\nthrough the red air, fluttering pitifully with their only\nwing, and when they hit the ground they crawl away\nlike maggots; but she can see other animals hanging\ndown motionless from the network of branches that\nforms the roof, she can see their eyes gleaming like\ndiamonds in a grotto, and suddenly they let go and\nswoop down, their glittering claws outstretched,\nthey\u2019re like big, big cats, sixty feet they fall, down to\nthe ground, and they thud down with a dull thump and\nshe can hear them hissing like cats as they struggle with\nthe animal they\u2019ve leapt upon and soon everything falls\nsilent, all the time the glittering one-winged butterflies\nkeep on stuttering down through the hot air - the drama\nis cruel yet stimulating, nice, her body is warmed up by\n\n278\n", "all the things happening above her and around her and\nnow the snake is lying between her legs, heavy and\nwarm and motionless \u2014 but suddenly he bursts into life\nand before she can move a muscle to prevent him, he\ncreeps inside her with all his terrifying length.\n\nShe wants to scream and fight and curse, but it\u2019s all\ntoo late and she has no choice but to go along with it -\nbut then comes the pain in her back which drives her\nmad, the snake\u2019s head forces its way along the inside of\nthe thin membrane covering her back, and he stretches\nout and stretches out into eternity, and soon he'll snap\nand she hopes he'll snap as soon as possible, if only this\ndevilish pain would abate, if only this horrible dirt\nfilling her existence would drain away together with\nher own defiled blood. But the pain only gets worse,\nand suddenly the armadillo launches itself out of the\ntree and swoops down towards her ina shower of blood,\nand with a scream, or maybe she only whispered a\nscream, she wakes up under the bush where she\u2019s been\nlying, but she feels no relief on discovering it was all a\ndream, she only feels the violent heat of a throbbing\nhatred rising inside her in waves, and as she drapes\nherself in her cloth once more and slowly gets to her\nfeet, she keeps on whispering with her hot lips, bursting\nwith desire, to somebody or other, \u2018Give me strength,\noh, give me strength to do it.\u2019\n\n9\nHe hides on the plateau until dusk falls, crouching\nbehind the natural barricade and listening, or rather\ntrying to forget to listen to all the things moving in the\ngrass and on the rocks down below. Although it\u2019s not\n279\n", "especially hot, although the wind is blowing with the\nirregular breathing of a feverish patient, his head is\nsweating as never before. He lies quite still so as not to\nprovoke his body, he unbuttons his clothes and lets the\nwind breathe directly on to his skin, but it\u2019s no good: he\nstill can\u2019t break free from his sweat. With an agonizing\nfeeling of disgust, he feels his pores opening quite\nindependently of his will and shedding their dirty tears,\nand he grows painfully aware of the smell, the smell\nfrom his sweaty body. Every time he breathes in, he can\nfeel the nasty, acrid smell surging into his nose and\nfilling the whole of his head with its brutal weight. And\neverything is clinging to him: his stinking trousers, his\nopen shirt, his clumsy shoes, and his hair \u2014 for the first\ntime in his life he can feel his hair pressing against his\nforehead, sucking on to his skin like a cold, slimy marine\ncreature that attaches itself to you while you're\nswimming, and then just won\u2019t let go, seems to fuse into\nyour forehead in the sunshine, and is impossible to get\nrid of until you go for another swim.\n\nIn order to have something to think about, and to\nmake sure none of the things he\u2019s afraid of can creep up\non him from behind, he starts thinking about his hair,\nhow he\u2019s always had, or at least for twenty-five years or\nmore has had ash-blond hair of varying thickness and\nsize; all kinds of things have happened, he\u2019s lost lots of\nthings and many of them have never been found, he\u2019s\nvoluntarily disposed of other things but then, un-\nfortunately, found them again; but there\u2019s one thing\nhe\u2019s never lost nor disposed of once and for all: his hair.\nYou could say he\u2019s been loyal to his hair even if he has\nbeen disloyal to quite a lot of other things. He strokes\nhis own hair like a mother, but he doesn\u2019t burst out\ncrying even though he knows he\u2019s going to die, he\u2019s\n\n280\n", "discovered how much salvation there is in being very\nsentimental, in stroking oneself, in being aglow with\npeace even though there might be an awful long time\nleft to live.\n\nThe thing about hair, he thinks to himself, is that hair\nis really a part of your life, perhaps a more important\npart of your life than you often think, and every time\nyou have it cut, you die, an important part of yourself is\ncut off, and although you survive you\u2019re more dead than\nyou were before your haircut even so; the innocent\nbarber is in fact a little executioner, an amputator\nwho\u2019s always doing you one of the last favours. And if\nthat\u2019s how it really is with hair \u2014 and why shouldn\u2019t it be\nwhen there are so many other things that are similar? -\nthen the same thing applies to our nails. Without a\nsecond thought and without reproaching ourselves in\nthe least, we cut our nails even though they may be just\nas much of our life as so much else, such as our eyes, such\nas our actions that we're so proud of, such as the\nthoughts we\u2019re even prouder of churning out, although\nin fact they\u2019re no more remarkable than our nails\ngrowing, or our hair.\n\nHe\u2019s lying face down and his sweat is making big\nstains on the rock, but he pretends not to notice and\nmaybe he doesn\u2019t in fact. He runs his fingertips over the\nragged horizons of his nails, and all the time he keeps his\neyes shut and tries to think of his life as a big nail, a\ngiant\u2019s nail on an otherwise insignificant creature. It\u2019s\ntrimmed occasionally by a pair of scissors or a file, or\nit\u2019s not trimmed at all and allowed to grow, big and\nshapeless and with lumps of black dirt under the rim,\nand eventually it grows so long it breaks off as a result of\nsome careless movement \u2014 finis, that\u2019s it, curtains, this\n\n-marvellous life no more than a dirty fingernail flushed\n281\n", "down the lavatory \u2014 or it\u2019s trimmed too much, every\nday the cruel scissors crawl along its edges and gnaw\nand gnaw away till the nail would cry out if only it\ncould. Other nails are as well trimmed as hedges, and\npolished until they shine, and they squirm with self-\nsatisfaction as soon as the hand they're growing on\nmoves, just as if they were completely independent of\nthe hand\u2019s movements, just as if the hand were their\nmost obedient servant.\n\nBoy Larus, lying there on the rock and dripping with\nsweat, just as accommodating torwards his cowardice\nas he\u2019s always been, closes his eyes so tightly, the\nshadows are imprinted into his retina, and he knows\nthat the tighter he can close them, the clearer his own\nposition in the universe will be to him; his own\nadventure is revealed in all its happy glow. Suddenly he\nsees the hand before him, the hand his life is clinging to\nlike a nail, a severely trimmed nail on a hard hand,\nperhaps the world\u2019s hardest hand, a hand much too\naccustomed to handling fire and red-hot iron to have\nany gentleness left when the time comes for a manicure.\nThen, he just grabs the first pair of shears he can find\nand cuts loose on the nail so that it doubles up in pain and\nsplits right down to the root.\n\nMaybe I should have had a different hand, thinks Boy\nLarus, maybe things would have been a bit better if my\nnail had been attached to another finger on another\nhand, but you can\u2019t choose your hands - and who\nknows what I might have ended up with instead,\nperhaps an executioner\u2019s hand, a thick-skinned scoun-\ndrel who trims his nails with his axe after every\nexecution.

He rolls over slowly on to his back, calm just\nfor a moment, and in a state of deep satisfaction he\nopens his eyes. The heavens loom high above him, blue\nwith many flashes of cloud; he stretches out an arm and\ngrasps hold of the wall and listens to the grass down\nbelow, no trace of anxiety, and it\u2019s rustling away with\nno sign of fear. The world is bright and cheerful, the\nman who\u2019s lying there is soon going to die and he knows\nit, but it\u2019s in the dim distance, and he\u2019s not particularly\nfrightened because there\u2019s no other way out after all,\nonce everything\u2019s come to an end, once all possibilities\nof living in peace have been eliminated, and every-\nthing\u2019s so simple, so horribly simple: a nail\u2019s going to be\nclipped right off, pulled out by the roots even, because\nits owner\u2019s grown tired of it \u2014 and so what, what\u2019s so\nremarkable about nails being trimmed, things that\nhappen every day without anybody thinking twice\nabout it?\n\nHe lies there as if anchored to the rock, and lets the\nsun \u2014 for the last time, maybe, he thinks, and the whole\nof his body glows in sympathy with the bold way he\ndares to think of it like that - lets the sun blaze down\nstraight into his face, it\u2019s still hot and the refined profile\nhe\u2019s always been so careful about, the way one\u2019s careful\nabout a rare china dish, sticks out from his face like a\nred-hot ember. He\u2019s just lying there peacefully and at\none with the world, and his past life isn\u2019t flashing past\nhis eyes like they say it does for people condemned to\ndeath, for all our friends who are dying. He\u2019s not\nthinking of anything in particular, he feels perfectly\n\n-contented, really contented because he deludes himself\n283\n", "into thinking he\u2019s accepted everything, knows all the\nrules now and isn\u2019t going to be put out by anything; he\nknows about hunger, thirst, sudden weariness, gradual\nfading away, and all that. He thinks he\u2019s accepted\neverything, but in fact he\u2019s accepted nothing at all, all\nhe\u2019s done is find some new prop in some new experience,\nit\u2019s like a mountain spring and he plunges the straw of\nhis fear into it and sucks and sucks till he chokes and\nbursts internally - and everything is as pointless as it\nwas always destined to be.\n\nBut nevertheless, he\u2019s had a new experience which\nalmost fills him with ecstasy because it\u2019s so incredibly\nunexpected, because he\u2019d never realized before he was\ncapable of any such thing.\n\nIt was that night the English girl was screaming\nsomething awful. To start with, she scared everybody\nstiff with her confused babbling, going up first to one\nand then the other and begging for quinine for some\npatient or other with malaria who might just be\nsaveable, or she asked where the boxer had disappeared\nto, wondered whether he\u2019d just gone for a walk or\nwhether he'd found some boat and left in it, in which\ncase it would be pretty tactless of him because he'd\npromised faithfully to take her with him in that case,\nafter all, they all knew how close she was to the boxer -\noh yes, they all knew that, and that\u2019s why they daren\u2019t\nyell at her to cut it out for God\u2019s sake, as the boxer had\npresumably died during the night and they\u2019d only\nnoticed the next morning when it was time to share out\nthe water and there was a different sort of smell coming\nfrom under the canvas, not quite so dirty but no less\nhorrible, and there were no more groans of pain to be\nheard, although they\u2019d all been listening for them witha\ntiny, tiny bit of hope. Somebody lifted the canvas\n\n284\n", "quickly, and then let it fall again even more quickly -\nthe English girl had been present then, and it was\nobvious from her face that she\u2019d caught on, even though\nshe tried later to hide all that behind an attitude of\ndefiant, convulsive lunacy.\n\nAnd this chaotic day was followed by a horrific\nnight, and the darker it became and the quieter it grew\non the island and over the endless ocean around them,\nthe more suspicious they were that her madness was\nreally play-acting. They all sat round the fire then,\nhuddled more closely together than ever before, more\nscared than ever before as well, because this hadn\u2019t been\nsome impersonal storm that no one can do anything\nabout anyway, or some raging floodwater you can\u2019t\npossibly beg for mercy, oh no, what made it so awful\nwas that it was something that could happen to any of\nthem at any moment, could affect any one of them\nwithout a moment\u2019s warning, and take hold of any of\nthem who were still normal and hurl them into the most\nterrible solitude: as lonely as a man lost in the depths of a\nforest filled with ghosts - oh, why couldn\u2019t he just be a\ngnarled trunk?\n\nThey could hear her mumbling away in the distance,\nsometimes monotonous and rambling, sometimes as\nclear as a bell, and that made them even more\nfrightened because it could be the first stages of a\nscream, a scream so terrible it would never cease being\nhurled backwards and forwards over the island like an\neternal echo. It was so dark round about them now,\neven though the fire was crackling, but it was so good to\nfeel their faces were mercifully hidden when this is how\nit was going to be no matter what. It was so good\nbecause you always notice these things first from\n\n_ people\u2019s faces: the English girl had suddenly acquired a\n285\n", "frown, a remarkable line running from one of her eyes\nand right up to the base of her hair, looking like a mark\nof extreme surprise, and her mouth was pursed without\nher knowing it: several times while all this was going\non, she tried to open it and say something, but her lips\njust wouldn\u2019t obey, and when she eventually mastered\nthem, she didn\u2019t seem to know what she was saying.\nAnd now they were all so grateful for the shadows cast\nby the firelight, because they didn\u2019t need to fear that\noutstretched, ruthless index finger aimed shakily\nstraight at them and backed up by that terrifying pupil\nscreaming at them all: There you are, you look just like\nher!\n\nAll the time Boy Larus had been frightened, but\nirritated as well, irritated because no one was taking the\ninitiative, because the captain didn\u2019t say what ought to\nbe said so that they could intervene and restrain her, and\nwhen the captain eventually put his decision to them he\nmore or less started shaking with joy and, filled with\ndetermination and ready to obey no matter how\nunpleasant things became, he strode out into the\ndarkness alongside the captain with a smile on his face,\nand he had a strange feeling of how marvellous it would\nbe to rub up against him briefly and he enjoyed the\nsensation of the warm sand tickling the soles of his feet.\nBoy Larus and the captain walked past quite close to her\nseveral times, talking all the while in an attempt to\nrouse her aggression so that during the unpleasantness\nthat followed they could tell her the whole truth. But it\nseemed impossible to attract her attention, and as they\nwere having trouble in putting up with the horrible\nsmell, the captain decided they should approach her one\nat a time, at intervals, and try to irritate her in various\nways.\n\n286\n", "But all of them came back depressed after having\nfailed, and her voice grew increasingly shrill and in the\ndarkness they could hear the scream creeping up over\nthe sand like a big, black animal that would suddenly\nstrike at their throats and somebody said the best thing\nto do might be to leave her alone until she fell asleep\nfrom the strain of keeping herself so terribly tense in\ntune with her mourning; but Boy Larus didn\u2019t dare\nabandon the idea that something might be done, and\nhence he kept on walking backwards and forwards in\nthe shallows behind her with the warm water lapping\nlusciously around his ankles, and occasionally he would\nstop just behind her and dig in the sand with his toes\nevidently without her noticing. Words just tumbled out\nof her in a confused torrent, and the more frightened he\nbecame, the further he went out into the water until it\ncame up as far as his knees, and then he stopped with his\nfeet buried comfortably under the sand and stared\ntowards the shore, at the silent group huddled around\nthe fire and the two motionless bundles straight in front\nof him, one of them silent and the other prattling, one\ndead and the other alive, and it dawned on him that no\none could see him standing there in the darkness and he\nfelt so protected from everything that was frightening\nand dangerous, he\u2019d fled to the safest place in the whole\nworld.\n\nIt was then he suddenly realized the English girl was\nlying naked in the sand, having cast aside the cloth she\nnormally wrapped round herself so carefully, and her\nbody was glistening like a rock of marble through the\ndarkness, glowing in the sand; her breasts and all the\nother contours of her body were gleaming with unusual\nintensity, it seemed that hot, glowing, slender chains\n\n. were trembling in a frenzy all over her body - and he\n287\n", "suddenly realized with a start that he was standing on\nthe beach very close to her: he must have wandered out\nof the water in a trance and now he\u2019d been brought to\nhis senses by his burning desire throbbing away inside\nhim and filling him with burning pus.\n\nThen somebody over by the fire moved so suddenly\nthat he couldn\u2019t fling himself down beside her for fear\nthat somebody might be approaching. Instead, he\nwithdrew hesitantly towards the fire, and the captain\nrose quickly to his feet and came to meet him, and\nslowly and quietly they sneaked up on the naked girl.\nThey stopped a yard or so short of her motionless head\nand listened vaguely to her ramblings as they gulped in\nthe flow from her outstretched body.\n\nThen Boy Larus let his discipline slip and he grabbed\nthe captain by the arm.\n\n\u201cSomebody ought to,\u2019 he said excitedly, \u2018somebody\nought to.\u201d\n\n\u2018I forbid you to do it,\u2019 said the captain sharply, and\nturned on heel so suddenly the sand screamed, and he\nmarched back to the fire with swaggering, brutal\nstrides.\n\nBoy Larus waded slowly out into the water, and just\nfor a moment he felt a stab of cold in his burning boil;\nbut once he was back with the water swirling round his\nknees, everything was just as it had been before. He was\nfacing the lagoon, and outlined against a little reef of\nstars on the bottom of the sky he could see a blurred\ndetail of the ship\u2019s outline, but then all he could see was\na little white rock shining forth from out of the water,\nand, all eager, he leant forward to grasp it, and the\nwater that crept up his thighs and his stomach was so\nburning hot, he had to forget all about the rock and\ninstead turn and walk towards land - and there it was,\n\n288\n", "that thing lying on the sand, and he was drawn towards\nit but even so he might never have gone down on his\nknees and pressed first his hands and then his arms and\nthen all of himself up against her if she hadn\u2019t asked for\nit, if she hadn\u2019t yelled at him to rape her.\n\nIt was then he ripped off his clothes, it was then he\nbecame so hot, no water in the world could have cooled\nhim down, and no ban, not even the most scarifying,\ncould have stopped him: always, he'd only been able to\nperform his best with the sort of girls that could\novercome his weakness by flinging all the words you\nshouldn\u2019t say into his face as he pressed himself against\nthem. He can\u2019t have known anything about how he\nhurled himself upon her and just what happened at the\nbeginning, but he came to his senses a little when it was\nall over and he was panting as he pressed his lips against\nher hot, white ear and found his mouth filling with sand,\nand then he came round a little bit more when she\ntwisted violently and with a thrust which only made\nhim feel all the more delirious she bit his shoulder blade,\nand as she struggled to throw him off, and succeeded\nbecause he had no strength left to resist, he was more or\nless wide awake again and waded out into the water to\nrinse the rest of his heat away.\n\nWhen he eventually returned to the fire, they were\nall sitting there as before, but not huddling in quite so\nmuch terror, and when he listened he realized the girl\nwas silent now and he just wondered whether they\nknew everything, or part of it, or nothing at all. And\nthen he realized that he didn\u2019t care, that it didn\u2019t matter\nwhat anybody thought or knew, all he could feel was\nthe sense of jubilation, jubilation over finally having\ndefied an instruction that something was prohibited,\nhaving disobeyed an order, having discovered for the\n\n289\n", "first time how his own will operated, having seen that\none can do whatever one likes, and that it\u2019s just\nmarvellous to do it.\n\nBut for the first few hours, indeed, fora large part of\nthat first day, he was still so paralysed with sheer joy\nthat he automatically responded to the captain\u2019s\nwhistles, but just occasionally it would dawn on him\nand he\u2019d recall his incredible experience, rather like a\nnew graduate the first day after the ceremony occasion-\nally glances at the diploma hanging on his bedroom wall\nand, with a pang of joy, thinks to himself: wow, I\u2019m a\nBA!\n\nAnd there they are sitting around the white rock,\nwhen suddenly he remembers: Of course, I have a will\nof my own, I can do whatever I like on this island, I\ndon\u2019t need to carve anything into this bit of stone; and\nso, shortly before dusk, he leaves the English girl and all\nthe time he\u2019s thinking he won\u2019t go back, that nobody\ncan make him go back if he doesn\u2019t want to. And so a\nlittle bit closer to sunset he\u2019s lying on his plateau and\nimagining himself as a badly treated nail that\u2019s soon\ngoing to be trimmed once and for all, but he\u2019s not afraid\nof that, he thinks. The image is so perfect and he\u2019s so\nproud of being able at last to do whatever he wants, and\nto think whatever he wants about anything he wants to\nthink about.\n\nHe stands up and the world is stained red by the\nsunset, but the rock beneath him has a wet outline from\nhis sweat; he doesn\u2019t want to think about that, though,\nhe hears somebody approaching through the grass, and\nhe climbs back over the parapet. It\u2019s about now I ought\nto be back there again, he thinks, that I ought to be\nstanding down there on the beach listening to those\nidiots babbling away, but what do they want with a\n\n290\n", "lion? Why bother about a lion when you can have\nsexual intercourse?\n\nWhen he starts clambering down the hillside, how-\never, he can feel a stabbing pain in a little bite on his\nright shoulder-blade, and he rubs it aimlessly with the\nindex finger of his left hand, and thinks it\u2019s probably just\na pimple after all.\n\n10\n\nThey leave Madame to her fate, then, without having\nseen her lying there in the grass, and the iguana they\u2019ve\nboth seen and smelt, they\u2019re walking closely inter-\ntwined and Boy Larus is slightly taller than the English\ngirl and he beats down the grass in front of them in\ntriumph. They suddenly come upon a biggish hollow in\nthe grass and so as not to remember what it was like\nwhen the captain caught up with him that time, he\nguides her to one side so that they only pass through\nuntouched grass and all the time he thinks he\u2019s the one\nwho\u2019s leading her, taking her to a quiet, hidden place\nwhere they can lie down together: the illusion of free\nwill has so benumbed his mind that he thinks every-\nthing\u2019s happening because he wants it to.\n\nBut in fact it\u2019s the English girl who\u2019s leading them\nboth to a certain place she has in mind, a quiet,\nundisturbed place that people rarely go to. Sometimes,\nshe glances up at him when he\u2019s not looking and sees her\nreflection in his contented smile and if she hadn\u2019t made\nup her mind what she was going to do, she\u2019d scream and\nrun away from him because it\u2019s all so disgusting, the\nstench of his body, the musty dampness he presses into\nher cloth when he clasps her tightly, the fear of failure,\n\n291\n", "although he\u2019s not yet aware of it, restricting his muscles\nand making his tender movements so horribly brutal.\n\nShe blesses the moment they arrive at the cliffs which\nfall steeply down to the beach at this point. There are\ntwo big rocks leaning towards each other in an\nembrace, and between them is a crevice, wide enough\nto let a big person pass through; it\u2019s the same crevice\nTim Solider climbed down when he was chasing the\nbox of his dreams; but there are no birds there now, the\nwhole of the flat ground they\u2019re standing on and all the\nledges on the cliff face are speckled with bird lime, and\nin the sunset it looks as if the rock is criss-crossed with\nred veins, as if the cliff face is bleeding.\n\nHe lets go of her because he\u2019s uncertain now, he\nhadn't expected anywhere so bare and inaccessible, and\neverything here is naked, everything so ruthlessly\nobvious when there\u2019s no darkness to hide in, no tall grass\nto give protection, and he\u2019s afraid his weakness will\ntrickle all over his face and expose him, and in near-\npanic, he wraps his arms round her and presses her\ntightly to him in desperation.\n\n\u201cShall we go into the grass instead?\u2019 he whispers,\nwhispers because he\u2019s afraid his voice will tremble if he\nspeaks out loud. \u201cThis place is no good.\u2019\n\nA wave of sweat and dirty animal warmth breaks\nover her and she struggles to wriggle free, struggles, but\nstruggles gently so that he won\u2019t have the slightest\nsuspicion. She caresses her way free from his embrace,\ntakes hold of him under his chin and raises it towards the\nred light and sees that all he wants to do still is to throw\nher down, bite her, and make animal love to her.\n\n\u2018Just a little while,\u2019 she says, \u2018we'll just stay here a\nlittle while. Then we can go into the grass and we can\n\n292\n", "roll around together and you can bite me while it\u2019s all\nhappening.\u2019\n\nAnd she notices with satisfaction how provoking\nlittle words can excite him, she doesn\u2019t need a whip to\nkeep him there, all she needs is a few hot little words.\n\nShe grips him gently by his damp shoulder and pulls\nhim down and they sit side by side on the cliff and watch\ntips of the rocks apparently burning away in the red,\ngradually fading light.\n\n\u201cWhat's it like, doing it with me?\u2019 she suddenly asks.\n\u201cYou see, I\u2019m so inexperienced, I don\u2019t know anything\nabout it, maybe you noticed it was my first time.\u2019\n\nHe bursts out laughing, and for that laugh alone she\u2019d\nhave done what she\u2019s going to do anyway, for nothing\nelse but that.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t worry about that,\u2019 he says, slapping her hard\non the back. \u2018Don\u2019t you worry yourself about that. I\ngave myself a good wash afterwards.\u2019\n\nHer fingers suddenly became so full of desire to\nstrangle him, but she has to control herself a bit longer,\nhe\u2019s so much stronger than she is after all, and he'd only\nget even more excited and fling himself on top of her\nand yell: You\u2019re hot stuff! like he did that other time.\nOh, he just lay there full of power and desire and\ntranslated her hatred into love.\n\n\u201cWhy did you bite me?\u2019 she asks, stroking the hard\nmembranes of his lips, \u2018why did you bite me so hard?\u2019\n\nHe bursts out laughing again and fumbles awkwardly\nafter her fingers.\n\n\u201cWhy did you bite me, come to that?\u2019 he asks. \u201cYou\nweren't exactly ice-cold yourself, you got your teeth\nstuck into me all right. You don\u2019t realize you\u2019re doing\nthat sort of thing, you see, you just do it because you re\n\n293\n", "feeling so wild. You did just the same, but you didn\u2019t\nknow that, did you?\u2019\n\nAnd he grows more eager and he starts pawing her\nbody and damp, cold hands start jumping like toads over\nher thighs.\n\n\u2018Once,\u2019 he whispers animatedly into her hair, \u2018once I\nhad a bit of skirt who bit my ear, nearly bit my ear right\noff in fact, when we were doing it. You can feel the scar\nif you put your fingers just here.\u201d\n\nNothing is too horrible to happen, nothing is so\ndisgusting that it can\u2019t happen to her. He grabs tight\nhold of her wrist and her fingers throb with pain as she\nfeels the bow-shaped scar on the inside of his ear.\n\n\u201cCan you feel it?\u2019 he whispers, and she can hear how\nexcited he is at the memory of it all and she lets her hand\nfall.\n\nThen she asks straight away, so that her silence won't\nalarm him, how it all happened, how they came to the\nboil together like that, as she can\u2019t remember much of\nwhat has happened since the boxer died, there\u2019s just a\nbig white vacuum between then and now, and of course\nhe delights in telling her all about it, with broad,\nboastful gestures, and that\u2019s exactly what she\u2019d ex-\npected. And as he\u2019s telling the story, he remembers his\ngreat discovery, how she helped him to recover his will,\nand he feels he must mention that as well, and indeed\nstress it because it can help him achieve the right degree\nof superiority.\n\n\u201cAnd so the captain said,\u2019 he concludes, placing her\npoor head between his legs, \u2018and so the captain said: I\nforbid you to do that, I forbid it in the strongest possible\nterms; but later, when it had happened anyway, he said\nthat since I'd done it even so, we can take it like men.\u2019\n\nMen, she thinks, men. Blowflies more like it. Men.\n\n294\n", "Blowflies. They crawl from one thing to another with\nall their filth and spread their wings and, the next time\nthey meet, boast about how terrific it was to defile this\nor that bit of cleanliness.\n\nSomeone goes past in the grass quite close by, and\nthey both sit up with a start for their separate reasons;\nbut no one appears, and soon all is quiet again.\n\nNow it\u2019s so dark that everything that\u2019s supposed to\nhappen should happen, the stones are still glistening and\nwhen he looks into her eyes he can see a little red gleam\nand for the sake of that red gleam he thrusts himself\nupon her with his mouth and bites her lips hard.\n\n\u201cYour eyes looked so bright and enticing,\u2019 he says\nafterwards as she lies curled up in his arms, quivering\nwith pain.\n\nShe strokes his hair which is cold and damp and sticky\nand clings to his skull like a thick, thick skin, and she\nwhispers, \u201cDarling, before we go into the grass, can I\nask you to do something for me?\u2019\n\n\u201cAsk me whatever you like.\u2019\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t know if I dare, it sounds so odd.\u2019\n\n\u2018Go on, say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d she says, trembling a bit, but he just thinks it\u2019s\nbecause she can hardly wait to get into the grass, \u2018it all\nhappened so quickly last night and I knew so little about\nit, | knew so little about my body and I knew nothing at\nall about yours. Can I, perhaps, can I see what you look\nlike naked?\u2019\n\nHe gives a whistle as he gets up and she\u2019ll make him\npay for that whistle when the time comes, and for the\nhorrible, disgusting way he flings his clothes off.\n\nThen she cuddles up close to him and guides him very\ncarefully to the edge of the crevice. They both look\n\n. down and the sea is glittering red as if it were full of\n295\n", "sunken lighthouses. He\u2019s standing right on the edge\nwith just his feet clinging hard but unwillingly to the\nhard stone and gazing down at the beach thirty yards\nbelow and the gap is suddenly filled with soft dusk and\nall the sharp edges of the cliff are smoothed away and\nfor a giddy moment he can feel the water sucking its\nway in between the rocks. Then she says slowly from\njust behind him, breathing heavily into his right\nshoulder, \u2018Just wait here a moment while I go into\nthe grass. Stand just like that, don\u2019t hold on to\nanything with your hands, just relax, relax, that\u2019s\nright.\u201d\n\nIt grows so silent and in the silence he thinks over her\nwords, spoken like a photographer, and then, when it\u2019s\ntoo late, he remembers what she was like on the beach\nduring the day, her looks and movements when she\ndiscovered what had happened to her during the night,\nbut by then, all of a sudden, the little push has launched\nhim out into space and he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s falling\nlike a trimmed nail or like a hero, a lion hurls its roaring\nmemory towards him and perhaps he remembers a tone\nof voice, the one that said: \u2018Why this last act of\ndisobedience, Boy Larus?\u2019\n\nBut it\u2019s too late.\n\n11\nHe\u2019s been walking slowly at first, but suddenly he\u2019s ina\nhurry and he starts running up the cliff path, without\nreally knowing why. Lucas Egmont, who\u2019s right at the\nfront, feels the tug of a hand on his arm and when he\nturns quickly, a little bit afraid, he finds Tim Solider\nstanding panting behind him, staring at the wounds in\n\n296\n", "his chest, and then he looks down at the cliff and notices\nthe trail of blood left by an iguana retreating into a bush\nand when he looks up again, he\u2019s smiling for the first\ntime since he landed on the island.\n\n\u2018I see there\u2019s a bit of your shirt missing,\u2019 he says to\nLucas Egmont. \u2018Thanks.\u2019\n\nThen he follows the trail into the bushes, but when he\ngets into the thick, almost impenetrable undergrowth,\nhe regrets having given way to a temporary whim and\nemerges again into the grass without having tried to\nfind and kill the iguana that attacked him. Just as he\nplunges into the grass, he can hear soft, animated voices\ncoming from a nearby bush and withdraws rapidly so as\nnot to disturb them. He follows the jagged line of\nundergrowth and eventually comes to a sheltered little\ncorner between a steep cliff and a thick clump of bushes,\nbut when he looks up he sees a whole crevice full of\nmotionless iguanas, perhaps asleep. He feels a pain in\nhis chest, but even so he sits down under the cliff: he\u2019s\nnever been the frightened type, never been afraid of\npeople who might want to hit him, injure him; he\u2019s only\nbeen afraid of his own body when it has suddenly\ndisintegrated into its pitiful constituent parts before his\nterrified eyes, when his legs haven\u2019t been able to move\nbecause he\u2019s seen an illustration in a textbook about the\nway leg muscles are constructed.\n\nHe\u2019s not strong at all now, of course. His face is quite\nhollow with hunger and he can\u2019t carry any significant\nburdens, especially after his latest loss of blood, but then\nthere\u2019s nothing to carry; however, despite all his\nweakness he doesn\u2019t feel as awful as that time when he\nthought he'd found a food chest but it turned out to be\nnothing more than a box of glass beads, a heavy, useless\n-box on which he threw away all he had left of his old\n\n297\n", "strength so that he could carry it back to his comrades in\ndistress. It felt so awful on that occasion because he was\nalone, he felt rejected by everybody, and when his\nhunger really started and he couldn\u2019t resist it any\nlonger, he was so happy to be rejected because in that\ncase he wouldn\u2019t need to share anything he found with\nany of the others, he didn\u2019t need to feel solidarity \u2014 but\nnevertheless, solidarity forced itself upon him; it wasn\u2019t\npossible to be as solitary as he\u2019d thought, and when he'd\ncalmed down, he realized it was a good thing, that in\nfact it was the best proof there was that he was still\nfunctioning like a real, living person, that when\nanybody has ever been really under pressure, solidarity\nis as essential as food and water. You can\u2019t survive\nwithout others, it\u2019s as simple as that, and hence\nsolidarity isn\u2019t in fact a trait of character; but there are\nmoments when you feel lonely and abandoned by\neverybody, and if on such occasions people don\u2019t just\nthink that even an outcast has his pride but instead\ndisplay solidarity in a given situation when they might\njust as well have displayed contempt and malevolence\ninstead, then solidarity is the only proof there is that you\naren\u2019t an iguana, a creature that simply lets its skin\ngrow when everybody turns against it.\n\nOf course, that business with the glass beads was a\nterrible shock for him. He\u2019d gambled everything on\nthat possibility, sacrificed several nights\u2019 dreams,\nsacrificed several days\u2019 terror, and finally struggled\nhard with himself over how to divide it all up - and the\nresult of his great efforts was simply: Madame\u2019s shrill\nlaughter, the mistrust of the others, and then all the\nrancorous expressions. In a flash, his world had\ncollapsed round about him, he lay there buried beneath\n\n298\n", "a house of cards, a heap of illusions, and didn\u2019t dare to\nmove in case the whole world came tumbling down.\nWhat was the point of it all, what was the point of all\nthe sacrifices, what was the point of all the courage,\nwhat was the use of all the good deeds if they only led to\na ridiculous result? The boundless immorality of ex-\nistence was suddenly crystal clear to him. Life was like\nrunning around in a gigantic labyrinth, one of those\nthey have for children at certain sophisticated fair-\ngrounds: in the middle was the pearl glittering so\ntemptingly on its stone, and as a young man, you\u2019d run\ninto it rosy-cheeked and certain in the trust you placed\nin the honesty of the labyrinth, and you'd run round and\nround for the first few circuits in the happy certainty\nthat you\u2019d soon reach the centre. And so it went on, all\nyour life through: you just kept on running, still\nconvinced about life\u2019s goodwill towards all those\npeople scurrying around eagerly; and only when it was\nfar too late did you notice that the route you were\nfollowing only seemed to be leading towards the\nmiddle. In fact, the builder had made several routes; and\nonly one of them leads to the pearl, and hence it\u2019s blind\ncoincidence and not all-seeing justice guiding the\ndestinies of the runners, and only when it\u2019s too late to\nturn back, if at all, do you realize that what you've been\ndevoting all your strength to only had a certain value in\nterms of effort, but could never lead to a practical\nresult. In such circumstances, it should be no surprise or\ndismay to anybody if the more clear-sighted contestants\nbreak away and miss out a few circuits in order to find a\nshort-cut to the centre. Call that immoral if you like,\ncall it criminal behaviour if you must, but you should\nbear in mind that a human being\u2019s immorality can never\nhope to compete with the well-oiled, perfectly\n299\n", "functioning criminality of the world order. On the one\nhand a rapidly flaring despair which takes on rather less\nthan balanced forms, on the other hand a conscious\nimmorality, gleaming coldly like nickel, proud of its\ncoldness and its shininess.\n\nThanks to that terrible failure with the box of glass\nbeads, he found himself more of an outcast than ever; he\nkept well out of everybody's way, and was careful to\nensure that no one would have any cause for complaint\nagainst him. He tended the fire as if it had been a sick\nlittle child in need of constant care, and as long as there\nwas still water slopping around in the keg, he dug it\ndeeper and deeper down in the sand every day, so as to\nkeep it cool. But he didn\u2019t do it out of a feeling of\nsolidarity: on the contrary, he was keeping his solidarity\nonice. What drove him to act as he did was the effort of\na servant to conceal failure, just as obvious a reaction as\nsweating when suffering from angst.\n\nBut then came the morning when the water keg was\nempty and the sand underneath it soaking wet. He\nrealized straight away that everyone would suspect\nhim, and knotted his face to protect himself from all the\nheavyweight stares hurling themselves at it to tear it to\npieces. The captain\u2019s attack was not as unexpected as\nthat of the iguanas, for when he eventually came round\nand found himself on the beach with bits of cloth stuck\nin the big wounds, the giant lizard bites were all he\ncould remember and he didn\u2019t spend much time\nwondering about how he\u2019d got down there again, he\njust assumed casually he'd managed to find his own way\nand then fallen and nobody had helped him; but then,\nwho would dream of assisting a glass bead catcher anda\nwater thief?\n\nHowever, soon afterwards when they were burying\n\n300\n", "the boxer and he was getting tired out from the least bit\nof effort, he started wondering about what had actually\nhappened, and then the merest glance at the steep cliff\nconvinced him how impossible it must have been for a\nsolitary, badly wounded person to drag himself down\nsuch a precipice without falling. Somebody must have\nhelped him, and he looked around to try and find\nout who. It couldn\u2019t have been either of the missing\nwomen: in the first place, they wouldn\u2019t have had the\nstrength, and moreover, they always radiated that half-\nunconscious bitter coolness women often surround\nthemselves with as a protection in case of attack. The\ncaptain was out of the question, of course, as this was a\nquestion of life and death and not some chivalrous\nparlour game. Actually, he was surprised the captain\nhadn\u2019t just thrown him straight over the cliff after the\niguanas had bitten him. Boy Larus was much too loyal\nto the captain and wouldn\u2019t dare do anything he might\nhave wished to do for his own sake but knew was\nagainst the captain\u2019s wishes.\n\nThat left Lucas Egmont, the Lucas Egmont nobody\nknew anything about, who maybe had something to\nhide or just looked as though he did - there are secretive\nfaces just as surely as there are open faces. And as he was\nlooking for him, he noticed the bits of cloth stuck in his\nwounds; of course, he'd seen them lots of times during\nthe course of that hot day, but he hadn\u2019t thought about\nwhat they looked like or where they\u2019d come from.\nNow, for the first time, he noticed the details. He felt\nthem and discovered they were bits of fine, soft\nmaterial, better quality than he'd ever felt before, and\nbefore they'd been stained by the dirt on the island and\nhis own blood, they had been white, and part of a white\nshirt.\n\n301\n", "They were all stripped to the waist as they worked,\nbut he walked over to the shadow of the cliff where\ntheir clothes were lying, and could see straight away\nthat Lucas Egmont\u2019s shirt was the one in question. He\nstroked the soft, white cloth briefly in gratitude, but\nalso because it felt so nice and cool against his skin, and\nwhen he went back to the grave, possibly intending to\nembrace his saviour, he saw him crawling up the beach\nwith staring eyes and quivering lips, his hands full of\nwet sand which he used to cover up the empty water\nkeg.\n\nIt was such an amazing sight, he just stood there, his\narms dangling, and watched; and the other two had also\nstopped working and were staring at him, but Lucas\nseemed oblivious to the lunacy of what he was doing\nand kept on crawling with a patience that was almost\nintolerable to watch, backwards and forwards between\nthe keg and the water, carving a little canal in the sand\nwith his knees.\n\nAll of a sudden, it dawned on Tim Solider what the\nothers hadn\u2019t yet realized: Lucas Egmont was the one\nwho'd emptied the water keg, and Tim first grew hot\nwith rage and wanted to run up to him and thrust his\nhead under the water, again and again, till it no longer\nhad the strength to raise itself any more, but then the\nheat of of the sun suddenly became so terrible that it\nwasn\u2019t possible to stick to a single resolve and he walked\nmechanically back to the water\u2019s edge below the\nboxer\u2019s grave and started carrying sand again, but his\nhead was swimming. For a while, he actually felt sorry\nfor Lucas Egmont: he wasn\u2019t an especially tall man at\nthe best of times, more or less normal, but now as he\ncrawled over the sand he seemed to be so hideously\n\n302\n", "shrunken that Tim was tempted to leave the boxer to his\nfate and instead help to bury the water keg.\n\nBut then came his thirst and rubbed away like pepper\nand ginger against his guts and intestines and stomach\nand throat, his mouth and his dry, chapped lips hated\nLucas Egmont with the greatest hatred in the world, or\non the island, at least. But afternoon arrived and\nbrought with it cooling shadows and quenched all\nhatred except just one and when they were sitting\naround the white rock and the captain was taunting him\nand hurting him with his biting superiority, he found\nonce again he was in league with Lucas Egmont, he was\nthe one Lucas Egmont was defending in his long speech,\nthey were his thoughts Lucas Egmont was presenting to\nthe audience, whether or not they were listening,\ngathered around the rock, and suddenly he felt the same\noverwhelming gratitude he\u2019d just felt at the burial.\n\n\u2018Solidarity,\u2019 he thought, \u2018solidarity from a water\nthief, but solidarity even so, the only time anybody has\noffered me any here on the island. I mustn\u2019t reject it,\nbecause it\u2019s the only solidarity in the world, because it\u2019s\nthe only sign provided so far by the world order that\nthere may be cracks in its compact injustice.\u2019\n\nNow he\u2019s lying in the angle between the cliff and the\nundergrowth, thinking about Lucas Egmont\u2019s lion, a\nsolitary lion. Oh, he doesn\u2019t need to wait until sunset\nbefore choosing sides, it\u2019s all clear to him already and he\ncan start fighting straight away; he feels glad, para-\ndoxically glad, because when all\u2019s said and done he\u2019s\ngoing to die at any moment, of his wounds, of hunger, of\nthirst, or of what at the moment is the worst of all, his\nbites. But he\u2019s glad because despite the late hour, he\u2019s\nbeen given an opportunity to show his solidarity with\n-something, with an idea, with a fellow human being,\n\n303\n", "with a symbol. He\u2019s glad because a life without water, a\nlife without food, a life without cinemas and banana\nskins, chewing gum and church bells, can still give\nsomebody who wants it a chance to defend himself\nagainst the indifferent criminality of the world.\n\nOnly symbolic? So what, what isn\u2019t symbolic? Aren\u2019t\nall our achievements, even if we are struggling in a\nworld where there are millions of human relationships\nand where we have the destinies of millions in our\nfingertips, aren\u2019t all our achievements so pitiful even so,\nthat the struggle we put up for them would be\nmeaningless if we didn\u2019t acknowledge the symbolic\nsignificance of the struggle, the significance of the\nstruggle as a struggle? Would it be possible to do\nanything at all, to perform a single deed, when the\npractical achievements are as puny as they are, if we\ndidn\u2019t acknowledge symbois as practical realities?\n\nSuddenly he can\u2019t bear to sit still any longer; he has\nholes in his chest but he thinks he can feel his life\nthrobbing stronger than ever behind those two rust-\ncoloured rags stuck there like corks in a big blood tank.\nHe\u2019s weak, but in a stimulating way, rather like after a\nlate-night party when you\u2019re on your way home and all\nthe thoughts that have to be thought and still haven\u2019t\nbeen thought come surging in over you and you're\nalmost stifled by your own weary vitality. He walks\nquite quickly through the grass, forces his way through\na few clumps of bushes, feels the hard shells of several\niguanas under his feet but has no time to worry about\nthem. When he reaches the cliff there\u2019s still some time\nto go before sunset and he settles down to watch the\nclouds spreading out over the stranded horizon in large\nclusters, looking like the smoke from cannons firing a\nsalute. He finds a stone up there as well, a narrow,\n\n304\n", "wedge-shaped hard stone which might be useful if you\nwant to carve something into a white rock. He takes it\nwith him, as well as some branches he\u2019d broken off ona\nprevious occasion but left up here on the cliff, but when\nhe gets down he suddenly remembers there's no fire\nburning anyway, and with an impatient gesture he\nthrows the branches out into the water without paying\nmuch attention to where they go. He puts the stone on\nthe rock and then stands gazing out over the lagoon,\nthinking about the shape of a lion. Then he suddenly\nfeels a prick in his right ear, it\u2019s as if a little flash of\nlightning had struck home there and he turns round\nwith the speed of a bird of prey and he sees the bird\nbobbing up and down like a big float where it\u2019s drifted\nin to the edge of the beach.\n\nHe\u2019s paralysed by the sight at first, he wants to laugh\nand to cry, and his face is actually contorted by a couple\nof sobs, but then he stiffens and looks round cautiously\nas he tiptoes towards the dead bird, as if he were afraid\nit would fly off and leave him all alone with his hunger,\nhis desperate hunger which is spreading its flames and\nburning through all the ceilings and all the floors of his\nintentions and expectations. And then he races forward\nand jabs his fingers into the stinking bird and, holding it\npressed tightly to his trumpeting chest, he gallops away\nover the beach, afraid all the time that someone will\nprevent him, shout at him to stop and share it. He\nslithers over the slippery ridge that marks the end of\ntheir strip of beach, and as he jumps on the shiny stones\nwhere little green animals with suckers as mouths are\nclinging and burst with a sploshy crack when he treads\non them, as he stumbles over the uneven surface of this\nbeach, he bursts out crying, violent, shuddering sobs\n\n- which force out the blood from the wounds in his chest,\n305\n", "and he\u2019s not crying with joy, not with joy at having at\nlast found something to satisfy his hunger, no, he\u2019s\ncrying with sorrow and hatred of himself because he\nhadn\u2019t been any stronger than that, and it\u2019s mainly from\ndesperation he takes a bite out of the bird, from\ndesperation rather than hunger, and suddenly he has a\nmouth full of feathers and he spits them out and then his\nmouth is full of loose, rotten meat and he vomits, lying\nface down on the slippery stones. And he vomits and\nvomits but that\u2019s not enough, he feels like a sewer and\nhe must have water, lots and lots of pure water to rinse\nall this horrible stuff out of his system, and so he lifts up\nhis miserable, shaking body as best as he can and crawls\nout into the water. But just here the bottom suddenly\ndrops vertically and he can\u2019t move at all to save himself\nas he sinks and he\u2019s probably too disgusted by himself to\nwant to even try and defend himself from the ocean\nwhich pours in through his mouth and chokes him. And\nhe sinks and sinks as far as he can go and right to the very\nend he has rotten bird in his mouth.\n12\nThe lion, king of the jungle. When Lucas Egmont is\nalone, he wanders around aimlessly through the grass\nand thinks thoughts about the lion. For someone like\nhim from a northern country, it was always so exciting\nwhen, asa child, he heard the lion described as the king\nof the jungle, for there weren\u2019t any lions in his country\nand, in the poor area where he lived, a boy went to the\ncircus just once and when he got back home a few lads\nfrom the street took him out into the courtyard and beat\nhim up with skipping ropes in among the dustbins\n306\n", "because he had a father rich enough to take him to a\ncircus. It was offensive somehow that the lion, the lion\nfrom so far away, should be the king of the jungle; it was\nas if a Negro king in Africa had suddenly declared\nhimself to be the king of some northern country and all\nanybody could do was to accept it because that\u2019s what it\nsaid in the school books.\n\nWhy is the lion king of the jungle, wonders Lucas\nEgmont as he wanders about in the grass, slashing at the\nlong stalks. Why not the elephant, why not the python,\nwhy not man? Is it because the lion is stronger than all\nother animals, cleverer or bigger? No, it\u2019s probably not\nbecause the lion is all that remarkable an animal in fact,\nbut it\u2019s got its status, been given its status because it\u2019s\nthe best symbol for regality anybody can think of. The\nactual concept of a lion is so unusually attractive to the\nessential part of our ego which deals with symbols,\nwhich lives in the world of symbols, which we despise\nprecisely because it isn\u2019t real, just as if there were\nanything especially honourable in being real, in being\nfaithful to your reality, when there are so many\nunrealities it\u2019s much more important to be faithful to.\n\nHe kneels down in the grass and catches a little\nyellow butterfly with little red blotches on its wings,\nand as he holds it in his hand one of its wings suddenly\ndrops off and turns into a clear drop of liquid which runs\nslowly down his clenched lifeline. He\u2019s never seen a\nbutterfly like this before, and he pokes at it carefully\nwith his nail, but even the slightest touch is obviously\ntoo much because it suddenly melts away and turns into\na grey lump and when he blows at it, it wafts away like\nash.\n\nIs a struggle of this nature defensible at all, he\n\n_ wonders, and he can still feel the tickling sensation in his\n307\n", "hand from the drop of butterfly, and see the cloud of ash\ndrifting down into the grass. Does it really make sense\nto give up any vestige of a struggle to survive, and\ninstead to devote ourselves to squabbling about the\nshape of a lion? But if we were to keep on living, if we\ntried catching fish or digging a well that could supply us\nwith water, if we devoted all our efforts to living for a\nfew more hours, wouldn\u2019t that also be a symbolic act, a\nsymbol for survival, not our own personal survival\nwhich doesn\u2019t matter a fig to us potential suicides, buta\nsymbol for the survival of the human race, which\ndoesn\u2019t worry us all that much either, but which our\nimagination, our talent for finding symbols, is so\ntempted to occupy itself with? Aren\u2019t all actions\nsymbolic in fact, is there such a thing as a meaningless\naction? And you could also ask: is there such a thing as a\nmeaningful action, or are there just symbolic actions?\nAren't our actions, no matter how mad or how\nmeaningless they might seem to a neutral observer, full\nof meaning when we have a specific symbolic intention\nwhen we perform them? When we tie a piece of string\nround the nearest oak tree and try to pull it down, it\u2019s\njust as meaningful an action as demolishing a house or\nhanging oneself in an attic, because all of them\nsymbolize the meaninglessness of all human effort.\nThose summers when I was able to accompany a well-\nto-do family to an archipelago, there were always a few\nislands enveloped in a shimmering blue haze, and we\nnever visited them because those islands symbolized for\nus the meaning of life, the shimmering, secret meaning\nof life, and it was so nice to have it constantly before our\neyes whenever we gazed out to sea, the meaningless sea;\nand the butterfly you have in your hand and poke at\nuntil it falls to pieces wouldn\u2019t mean anything in itself -\n308\n", "for what\u2019s the significance of a drop of some sort of fluid\nand a little cloud of ash? - it wouldn't mean anything at\nall if it didn\u2019t symbolize the depravity of poking around,\nof poking too closely at the truth of the world.\n\nHe crouches in the grass, listening. There are plenty\nof voices and footsteps all round him, and he suddenly\nthinks of all the lions that have suddenly been born on\nthe island and are trampling down the grass with their\nheavy paws. He\u2019s so curious about, and at the same time\nafraid of the others\u2019 decisions: it will be difficult for him\nto give way if the captain\u2019s lion turns out the winner, not\nfor his own sake, as he likes to think the whole business\ndoesn\u2019t mean anything to him, but for the others whose\nreality he\u2019s tried to identify himself with, having\nrealized how terribly difficult they found it to for-\nmulate their opposition to the captain. He thinks it\u2019s\ntheir thoughts he\u2019s going round thinking, just as if you\ncould think a single thought or express a single opinion\nwithout having to accept responsibility for it yourself,\nand he gets quite a shock when he suddenly finds he\u2019s\ncome to the edge of the grass where there\u2019s a terrible\nsmell of something dead which he nevertheless can\u2019t\nsee, but he does see Boy Larus and the English girl with\ntheir bodies closely intertwined beside a cliff reflecting\nthe red sunset. They sit up with a start when they hear\nhim coming, and move apart, but he stands absolutely\nstill, to fool them, and before long Boy Larus pulls her\ntowards him again and he wants to run up to them and\nshout at them and ask what they think they're doing,\nkissing and cuddling has to wait when there\u2019s so much\nelse at stake, there\u2019s a lion which is so much more\nimportant than any particular mouth, he\u2019s really upset,\nthe identifier, that they have failed to justify his trust,\n\n309\n", "but in the end he hasn\u2019t the heart to spoil their happiness\nand he glides away like a pike in the reeds.\n\nLots of people have left trails behind them in the grass\nnow, and he follows a winding path into the under-\ngrowth and notices for the first time how oddly shaped\nthe bushes are, it\u2019s as if he\u2019d never really seen them\nbefore, they'd only flitted past his eyes, looking green\nand prickly. As there is still a while to go before sunset,\nhe has a good look at a big bush with bulging leaves and\nhairy branches. He tugs playfully at the bush\u2019s hair in an\nattempt to pull some out, but it doesn\u2019t budge at all.\nThen his fingers suddenly brush up against a little pouch\nhanging down from one of the branches above, and\nwhen he looks more closely he sees the whole bush is full\nof green pouches, miniature pumpkins, and when he\nplucks a few he notices a splashing sound from inside\nthem. He thinks at first he\u2019s misheard, but when he\nholds one to his ear, he discovers it\u2019s full of some sort of\nliquid. He carefully breaks it in two and produces two\nhalves, each of them filled with a clear liquid looking\nlike water, and all at once he becomes so agonizingly\naware of his thirst, and he has a sudden urge to throw\nthe halves away and to run off so as not to be tempted\nany more, but instead he raises one half of the pouch\ntowards his lips.\n\nThere\u2019s a violent rustling noise in a nearby bush and\nsomebody comes rushing out and Lucas Egmont realizes\nhe\u2019s been watched all the time.\n\n\u2018Be careful, Mr Egmont,\u2019 yells the captain, \u201cdon\u2019t\ndrink that whatever you do! That innocent-looking\nlittle green thing contains one of the most dangerous\npoisons there is. In some places in the islands, the natives\ndip their poisoned darts in it to make them really\neffective.\u2019\n\n310\n", "Then Lucas Egmont\u2019s hands start shaking and the\ngrass and the bushes flow out and are elongated like\nshadows in disturbed water, but the captain grabs him\nreassuringly by the wrists and although Lucas is\nthinking desperately about the lion, it\u2019s quite a while\nbefore he can keep his hands still. The captain pulls\nanother fruit from the bush, however, and opens it, and\nthey both go into a clump of undergrowth by the rock\nand the captain leans over the rock and places the two\nhalves on the gleaming stone and then withdraws into\nhiding once more.\n\nAfter a while, a big iguana comes crawling from near\nthe edge of the cliff and they can see immediately it has\ncaught sight of the two halves but, possibly because it\u2019s\nconscious of how terribly dangerous they are, it doesn\u2019t\ndare to go any nearer. It goes round and round them, but\nthe circles get smaller and smaller and suddenly there it\nis, lapping up the contents of first one and then, after a\nmoment\u2019s hesitation, the other as well. Then the iguana\nplays around with the empty shells for a while before\nsuddenly leaping up into the air with a horrific\ngrowling noise, and Lucas Egmont thinks it\u2019s still\nplaying but it\u2019s dead and stiff by the time it hits the\nground.\n\nThe captain kicks the iguana casually over the edge of\nthe cliffand they hear it hit the sand with a dull thud and\nwhen they eventually get down there themselves there\nare just three dead bodies waiting for them in silence\nand emptiness, two iguanas and one human. The captain\nputs his hand protectively on Lucas\u2019s wrist and smiles at\nhim so intimately that Lucas can\u2019t help but realize what\nthe captain expects of him in return for having saved his\nlife.\n\n_ One can put up with false friends, Lucas thinks to\n311\n", "himself as he draws back his hand, but God protect us\nfrom false enemies whose animosity you can\u2019t count on.\n13\nOh yes, there are three dead bodies waiting for them,\nbut no living person and the dead boxer is waiting for\nthem more than ever. They don\u2019t notice at first, but\nwhen they kneel down by the white rock and start\nexamining the stone Tim Solider had found for them,\nthey hear an all too familiar sound: it\u2019s a piece of canvas\nflapping in the breeze, and they\u2019re both quite shocked\nwhen they see the boxer lying there, just as he was\nbefore they buried him, with only a piece of canvas over\nhis body. Somebody has scraped away all the sand and\nthe beach is churned up by feet that seemed to be in a\nvery great hurry, and they think they can follow the\ntrail, the light footsteps leading away over the sand.\nBut before they take up the chase, they go up to the\nboxer, cautiously, as though they\u2019re afraid he might\nsuddenly get up and reveal his terrible secrets. They\nkneel down beside him and are almost bowled over by\nthe stench, but he\u2019s hidden from their view: he\u2019s not\nonly covered by a sheet of canvas, he\u2019s also wrapped ina\npiece of thick, grey cloth, the English girl\u2019s cloth.\nThey follow her trail the length of the lagoon. She\u2019s\nbeen uncertain about the precise route she should take,\nsometimes running out into the water as far as the point\nwhere the bottom suddenly falls away and it gets very\ndeep, at other times she has splashed along in the\nshallows, or moved quite a way inland. Then the beach\ncomes to an end, however, and a submerged rock runs\nout into the lagoon that peters out a bit further ahead\n", "and the girl has skirted round that before striking out at\nright-angles inland; it\u2019s all stone now, and hard to keep\ntrack of her, but occasionally she\u2019s strayed out into the\nmud and perhaps sunk down over her ankles before\nwithrawing to the stones once more. The captain\nsuddenly kneels down, and without a word points at a\nlarge rock a little way out in the water. There\u2019s a little\nred stain on it, fresh blood, still not congealed. Then\nthere are more or less similar red marks on lots of stones\nleading to a low cliff that drops steeply down to the\ndeep water below, some fifty yards beyond the end of\nthe lagoon.\n\nLucas Egmont gets down on his stomach and shuffles\nhis way to the edge of the precipice and shields his eyes\nwith his hand so that he can see down into the water. It\u2019s\nall green for a long way down, but then he suspects the\ngreen gives way to something white shimmering\nthrough the water. But he can\u2019t make out any clear\noutline, the white patch just spreads and contracts, it\ncould be a white rock or it could be a girl\u2019s corpse or it\ncould be an optical illusion. It could be nothing more\nstartling than an optical illusion. He throws a little\nstone at it, and watches it whirling round as it sinks\nbefore slowly coming to rest right in the middle of the\nwhite thing, like a frog on a cushion. But the next\nmoment everything has disappeared, something has\nbeen edging its way along the bottom and stirring up the\nmud, and no matter how much he strains his eyes, he\ncan\u2019t see anything, nothing at all of the white, just some\nkind of ray floating up and down between the bottom\nand the surface like an underwater lift.\n\nWhen they get back to the beach, an enormous flock\nof birds takes off from some stones only a few hundred\n\n_yards from where they are. The birds rise in complete\n313\n", "silence, and when their curiosity drives them forward\nto investigate, they see a little white bundle bobbing\nagainst the rocks where the water occasionally surges in\nand tries to snatch it away.\n\n\u2018They're. eating their own kind,\u2019 says the captain,\nkicking at a rock in scornful disgust, \u2018just like us.\u2019\n\nWhen they then sit down on either side of the white\nrock, they notice how the birds are hovering directly\nabove them, more or less motionless, their gigantic\nwings outstretched.\n\nBut Lucas Egmont isn\u2019t really thinking about the\nunpleasant birds, he\u2019s thinking about all kinds of other\nthings; he realizes straight away that none of the others\nwill ever come back, because none of this was anything\nto do with them, because they weren\u2019t talking the same\nlanguage, because they weren\u2019t talking any language at\nall, because they were just living for their unarticulated\nneeds and had to be exploded when they suddenly\ndiscovered their needs could no longer be satisfied and\nthey could no longer control their explosions. He has\nover-estimated their interest in opposing the immovable\ninjustice of the world, their interest in the apparently\nmeaningless action which is going to shake the world,\ntheir understanding of a man\u2019s essential task: to say at\nleast half the truth about the whole lie that is the world.\nHe\u2019s been identifying with them, not with them as they\nwere but as what he thought they ought to be, and\ntherefore, he acknowledges, therefore he must accept\nthe awful responsibility of the identifier, the terrible\nburden; he must be like one of these people he\u2019s been\nidentifying with. Hence he doesn\u2019t pay too much\nattention to the captain\u2019s obvious aim of frightening\nhim when he suddenly raises his hands heavenwards and\nexclaims, \u2018Just look at those birds, Mr Egmont, those\n\n314\n", "beautiful birds up there over our heads! How silent they\nare as they wait to have a go at our necks!\u2019\n14\n\nDusk is settling over the beach and over the sea and the\nwater has almost ceased glittering. The wind gusts from\ntime to time and there is a creaking from the masts of\nthe ship, but apart from that, everything is more or less\nsilent. One or other of them occasionally picks up a\nstone, throws it up in the air and catches it again, or\ndrops it on to the rock, or one of them scratches a line on\nthe rock but then stops because the other is staring at\nhim so mercilessly.\n\nIn the end, the captain says, \u201cWell, it'll soon be dark,\nand if we\u2019re going to get started today we'd better get\ngoing as soon as possible, and we've got to know where\nwe stand because it will be obvious even from the very\nfirst lines whether the lion is going to symbolize\nsolitude or some kind of togetherness. I\u2019m not at all\nclear about how you envisage the whole thing. You're\ntalking about a solitary lion, right, but how is a lion\nthat\u2019s so alone going to be able to symbolize anything\nother than solitude, a particular kind of solitude, not\ntotal solitude, as opposed to my lion with it\u2019s foot on the\ndead body?\u2019\n\nLucas Egmont responds to that as follows:\n\n\u2018In the first place, it wasn\u2019t my suggestion from the\nstart that we should choose a lion, but when that was\nwhat was agreed, it seemed to me the image of the lion\nyou were proposing was quite unacceptable. Unaccept-\nable because it celebrates cruelty, the cruelty of anyone\nwho, voluntarily and with eyes wide open, embraces\n\n315\n", "solitude, kills off anything that is weak and fragile,\nanything that needs togetherness, so that eventually all\nthat will survive will be cruel, solitary creatures, the\nkind who love solitude as the only thing they can\ncomprehend. A solitary lion, on the other hand, sitting\nthere without trampling anyone underfoot, is some-\nthing completely different. I won\u2019t go as far as to\nsuggest it represents togetherness, but it does demon-\nstrate calm strength, the whole personality, the\nharmony which might be rent asunder at any moment\nby the roar of a wild beast. Terror and harmony in the\nsame character, you see, that\u2019s my lion. Personally,\nI'd have preferred to take a snake as a symbol. It\u2019s easier\nto carve into a rock, and it also says more about the\nhorror that suddenly surges through your veins like a\nblood clot when it gets dark and your enemies find it\nso much easier to hide both themselves and their\nintentions.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sticking to my lion,\u2019 says the captain. \u201cGood\nGod, what do you know about solitude? What do you\nknow about the loneliness one feels in an attic after the\nroof has blown off and sailed away like a pair of swan\u2019s\nwings? What do you know about the boundless solitude\nof the world, it\u2019s greater than anyone dares to imagine,\napart from a few ecstatic moments when there\u2019s\nnothing you can do about them, but even so, you can\nfeel it in every nerve-end.\u2019\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t think anybody can take any account of your\nkind of solitude,\u2019 says Lucas Egmont. \u2018You enjoy it. As\nfar as you're concerned, it\u2019s the greatest pleasure the\nworld has to offer, instead of the greatest injustice.\nYou\u2019re never alone in fact, you always carry your\nsolitude around with you, you have your head stuck in it\nas though it were a big bag, and when you want to\n\n316\n", "experience yourself, because that\u2019s what you're doing\nwhen you say you're experiencing solitude, like a\nmasturbator, when you want to experience yourself, all\nyou do is pull the bag further down over your head till\nyou almost choke and there\u2019s nothing you like more\nthan choking. Just remember that.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not true that I enjoy it,\u2019 says the captain, \u201cbut you\nmust understand that the only way I can bear the\nenormous solitude that so often affects me is to accept it\nas a gift, as a welcome delight; and that\u2019s also why I\nthink the little loneliness, the thing that X or Y feels\nwhen the mood strikes him, is much more dangerous to\nthe health of the world than mine. Only the strongest of\nmen can bear a solitude like mine. You need the right\nkind of ear-drums for a start, strong ear-drums that can\nput up with the terrible weight pressing down on them\nwhen space suddenly starts singing of solitude.\u2019\n\n\u2018Have you really heard that song you talk about?\u2019\n\n\u201cOh yes, of course, quite a lot of us have heard it. And\nyou!\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018I can teach you to hear it if you like. It\u2019s quite easy,\nyou see; of course, it\u2019s hardest the first time, but after a\nwhile you learn how to do it and it only needs a certain\nkind of thing to happen, feelings of aversion radiating\ntowards you, contempt, hatred, and suddenly there you\nare, in this, the clearest of all spaces.\u2019\n\nThe captain has gone over to Lucas Egmont\u2019s side,\nand now he sits down beside him and lifts up his hand\nand strokes it over his own as if it were a bow. Lucas\nglances at him and sees his face is covered in sweat,\ncovered in crawling sweat.\n\n\u2018Are you so afraid,\u2019 he says contemptuously, taking\n\nS17\n", "his arm away, \u2018are you so afraid of being alone? Can\u2019t\nyour ear-drums cope any longer?\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not afraid,\u2019 answers the captain vehemently,\n\u2018I\u2019m not afraid of being alone.\u2019\n\nThen he suddenly falls silent and stares down at the\nsand, and fear starts shaping his face skilfully, replacing\nhis dimples with terror lines and the furrows get deeper\nand deeper. He picks up the stone and starts tapping it\non the rock, making big black holes in the silence.\n\n\u201cWhat would you do if I left you?\u2019 asks Lucas\nEgmont. \u2018It would be so easy for me to run away after\nall, [could run up into the grass and hide there as long as\nyou like and not reply no matter how much you shouted\nto me, not reply even when you started crying and\nsobbing out my name.\u2019\n\n\u2018I wouldn\u2019t go looking for you,\u2019 says the captain\ncurtly, \u2018I\u2019d just take this stone and carve a lion, the lion\nthat\u2019s on the back of my boot with a dead human\nunderneath it, and then when I\u2019d done that I\u2019d lie down\nbeside the rock and slowly glide into the ultimate\nsolitude and my ear-drums would burst and my heart\nwould stand still, but that wouldn\u2019t matter because I\u2019d\nnever have been able to penetrate any further into\nsolitude than that anyway.\u2019\n\n\u201cWould you take that frightened face of yours with\nyou as well?\u2019 asks Lucas Egmont. \u201cDo you think that\nwould burst as well, or that it would keep its fear even\nwhen your space started singing?\n\n\u2018Do you think I don\u2019t understand,\u2019 he goes on\npassionately when the captain looks the other way, \u201cdo\nyou think I don\u2019t understand all this perfectly well,\nunderstand why you\u2019ve come and sat down beside me\nnow, hoping to infect me with your solitude? It\u2019s\nbecause you've noticed we\u2019re suddenly on our own, that\n\n318\n", "all the others have disappeared into the sunset and will\nnever come back. They simply weren't interested in\nwhat we were planning to do, in all that lion business;\nnot even your pretty little underling Boy Larus obeyed\nyou on this occasion: just before I came down I saw him\ncuddling the English girl on a cliff up there. Now you're\nso frightened I'll go away as well that you\u2019re trying to\nkeep me here by making me just as sick as you are, by\ninfecting me with the same terrible illness as you have.\nOf course it\u2019s true you've been alone before, as you say,\nbut as you're realizing, that was something quite\ndifferent: you\u2019ve always had unlimited access to other\npeople, you've always known you would wake up out of\nyour drugged sleep into a normal environment con-\ntaining just as much solitude as you needed in order to\nbecome fully conscious again. But here, you don\u2019t dare\nto dive down into your great solitude because you never\nknow what things are going to look like when you come\nback again. By then, here could be an even greater\nsolitude than any of those others you\u2019ve experienced\nduring the whole of your life hitherto, and you want to\nguard against that by taking me with you: but you won\u2019t\nsucceed, and that\u2019s why you're miserable and bitter\nnow, and don\u2019t dare to look me in the eye because I've\ntold you the truth as it is. But you'd better watch out:\nI\u2019m also infectious. I\u2019ve also got a disease, but I\u2019m not\ngoing to try and pass it on to you, because you'd\ncertainly never understand how to bear that illness,\nbecause you'd just think it was a pleasure, like all the\nother illnesses you've ever had.\u2019\n\n\u2018What kind of an illness is that, then?\u2019 asks the captain\nin a hollow voice, his face averted.\n\n\u2018It\u2019s the illness called guilt,\u2019 says Lucas Egmont. \u2018It\u2019s\nalso a disease you can play around with like you do, you\n\n319\n", "can also turn it into a pleasure if you want to, it can also\nuplift you into the most extreme states of bliss. In any\ncase, I can assure you it\u2019s a terrible experience to wake\nup with a throbbing head, without having been to a\nparty the night before, suddenly to wake up and feel you\nhaven\u2019t the strength to get up any more that day, that\nweek, that year or that life; simply not have the\nstrength, you see, because you're bearing all the guilt in\nthe world like a pillar of copper on your forehead, and\nevery attempt to get up will just mean you fall over and\nsuffer terrible injuries and you want to avoid that. Ah\nwell, you lie there for a few days until someone comes\nalong and establishes that you\u2019re not ill at all, just too\nlazy to get up. Start dancing the Charleston, they tell\nyou, and you'll be fine, all your joints will be perfect.\nAnd of course you want to be perfect, in your joints and\neverywhere else, but it\u2019s not long before you discover\nperfect doesn\u2019t mean what you thought it meant, not by\nany means. Oh no, being perfect means mainly turning a\nblind eye on the guilt of the world, it means dancing on\nthe left-hand side of the dance floor when there\u2019s\nshooting and bloodshed going on over to the right.\nWell, obviously, you can get used to it after a while;\nI\u2019ve got used to walking upright, for instance, as you\ncan see, though it was a bit hard at first, that\u2019s true, with\nall your advisers crowding round and considering and\nthinking and passing opinions to the effect that it wasn\u2019t\nworth overdoing things. That it was best to have a\nrucksack with you when you went walking through\nforests and over moors. Of course, you were grateful\nfor so much helpfulness, but it couldn\u2019t do much about\nthat fault which you considered to be the biggest one in\nthe world: that there were so few people helping each\nother to bear the guilt of the world, so few with a\n320\n", "conscience that the burden they had to bear was almost\nintolerable. You see, the guilt of the world is something\nquite different from the world\u2019s solitude: there are so\nmany of you sharing the world\u2019s solitude that there isn\u2019t\nall that much of it for each one of you to bear, just a\nreasonable burden for a man to put up with, if that; but\nwhen it comes to guilt, you\u2019re overloaded.\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat was it you felt guilty about? What have you\ndone, what crime have you been guilty of?\u2019\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s what\u2019s so paradoxical about it all, you see.\nI haven\u2019t done anything, or at least, I hadn\u2019t done\nanything \u2014 not then. I was completely innocent - and\nyet I felt guilty. I thought I was responsible for\neverything that happened, it was my fault that the slum\nwhere my parents still lived even after I\u2019d rented a little\nroom closer to the bank, that the slum was teeming with\nchildren suffering from consumption, it was my fault\nthat so many old people died in poverty in hostels dotted\nall over the city, and I even felt stabs of guilt every time\nI saw a beggar or some poor soul with pock-marks all\nover his face. Of course, I tried to help, using all the\nmeans at my disposal in order to reduce my guilt, and I\ntried all the channels open to a citizen who wants to do\nsomething to assist the underprivileged, but I have to\nsay I found all of them inadequate, and in some cases\ncriminally inadequate. The charities disgusted me with\ntheir onanistic self-satisfaction, it was as if they had to\nlook at themselves in a mirror after every good deed to\ncheck whether they\u2019d acquired a new little wrinkle\nround their mouths advertising their kindness. The\npolitical parties spent far too much energy on peripheral\nquestions, claimed they were transforming the whole of\nsociety, a transformation which would liberate the\nworld from the injustices currently bearing down on\n\n321\n", "my forehead, in the long run: but that was just a cynical\nway of referring to a permanent postponement, that\u2019s\nwhat they really meant. Occasionally they took up\nsome of the problems of the very poorest in their\npropaganda, and what really disgusted me most about\nthe whole thing was the way the poverty of the world\nwas used as advertising material for a political party,\nthat a self-evident thing like reducing the number of\nchildren with tuberculosis became a publicity stunt for\na party whose behaviour in other respects has to be\nregarded with suspicion and even contempt. No, for\nguilty people like us there was no organization, the\ndistress of the world was being taken in hand by people\nwho'd ceased to feel guilty, if they ever had felt guilty\nat all, because they lived under the illusion that they\nwere doing such an awful lot to ease it. The biggest\nproblem, it seemed to me, was that people were talking\nso much about ideas, that\u2019s what took up so much of\ntheir energy; but I think ideas are something for the\nnursery. You need ideas, of course, but you should play\nwith them; ideas are the pretty little toys grown-ups\nplay with. It seemed to me, contests concerning ideas\nwere taking place at the wrong level altogether: instead\nof sitting round tables where the fate of the world is\nsupposed to be decided with the ideas they cherished so\nunscrupulously and with such sadistic logic, they should\nhave been gathering at tennis courts and playing tennis\nfor their ideas, or in a big theatre where they could act\nout scenes with them, or in big, green meadows where\nthey could chase after them in the sunshine with\nbutterfly nets. There\u2019s nothing more dangerous than\ntaking ideas seriously, and nothing more praiseworthy,\nin fact I'd go as far as to say it\u2019s the only praiseworthy\nthing in this life, than taking ideas for the playthings\n322\n", "they are in fact. Here we are, you and me, sitting here\nplaying, and there\u2019s nothing in the whole world more\nimportant than this lion, yours and mine. Symbol as\nsymbol - there are no gradations in the world of\nsymbols, everything is equally big or equally small,\nthat\u2019s what\u2019s so splendid about it. What happened next?\nWell -I grew tired of not being able to do anything but\nfeeling as if | could do everything; I was falling between\ntwo stools, and in that situation I made up my mind on\none thing. I decided to acquire real guilt, guilt I could\nreally accept on my own behalf, guilt I could describe as\nbeing my very own so that I was the one who should\nbear it and nobody else. And so I pulled off a pretty bold\nfeat of embezzlement, and with substantial funds in my\npockets I'd left the country on the very first day of my\nholiday and was well on my way toa life to be lived in\nrelative freedom from guilt; but it all turned out rather\ndifferently from what I\u2019d expected.\u2019\n\nHe\u2019s been talking into the space beyond the cliff,\noblivious of everything round about him, and now the\ncaptain takes advantage of his carelessness and hurls\nhimself on top of him, and as he presses his back\nruthlessly against the rock, he shrieks, \u2018Now you help\nme to carve my lion into the rock, we'll have no more of\nthis nonsense, I\u2019ve had enough of your stupid prattle.\nWhy do you think I saved your life - so that you could\nget in my way? Don\u2019t you think I had a reason for\nstopping you drinking that devil\u2019s potion? The point\nwas that you need at least two people to do a job like\nthis, the work involved calls for two people, you might\nsay. I can force you to help me because I\u2019m stronger\nthan you, oh yes, I can buy you because I've got pockets\nfull of glass beads and that\u2019s the only currency we've got\nhere on the island.\u2019\n", "The edge of the rock is cutting into his shoulder-\nblade like a knife, and although Lucas Egmont twists\nand turns, he can\u2019t break loose.\n\n\u201cCaptain,\u201d he whispers, \u2018you can\u2019t force me the way\nyou say you can. You can beat me to death, but you\ncan\u2019t force me to carve that lion of yours. You can even\ntie me up, but when I\u2019m tied up you've got even less\nchance of making me do what I don\u2019t want to do. And in\nany case, I\u2019ve no reason to be grateful to you for saving\nmy life in the way you think.\u2019\n\nNo, he has no reason at all to be grateful. This is a life\nand death struggle, and the question of gratitude is\nhardly the most important one. It\u2019s more important to\nknow whether you are capable of killing someone\nwho\u2019s saved your life. Maybe you can.\n\n\u2018This isn\u2019t fair play, captain,\u2019 he goes on, \u2018and it\u2019s not\ndoing you any good. You\u2019re just wasting time and it\u2019s\ngetting darker and darker. Before long we won\u2019t be\nable to distinguish the drawing on your boot any longer\n\u2014 you've got to remember we haven\u2019t got a fire any\nmore. No, there\u2019s another way, a way that\u2019s fair play\nand is quickly settled, and what we do is to set each\nother tasks, difficult ones but not impossible, and\nwhoever fails to perform what\u2019s asked of him has lost,\nand his lion is defeated.\u2019\n\nThe captain releases him and sits down on the other\nside of the rock and keeps tapping away incessantly at\nthe leg of his boot.\n\n\u201cWe'll draw lots to decide who goes first,\u2019 says Lucas\nEgmont. \u2018Whoever gets the stone I have in one of my\nhands has lost.\u2019\n\nHe holds out both his clenched fists and, after a little\nworried hesitation, the captain chooses his left hand\nand there\u2019s a stone in both of them and quickly and\n\n324\n", "unobtrusively he drops the little stone in his right hand\non to his knee and then holds it out to demonstrate that\nit\u2019s empty.\n\nThe captain stands up and an anxious little smile flits\nround his mouth like a butterfly.\n\n\u201cWell, what have you got lined up for me, Egmont?\u201d\nhe asks, pretending to be unconcerned although he\u2019s\nshaking like a leaf.\n\n\u201cSwim across the lagoon,\u2019 says Lucas quickly so that\nhis voice doesn\u2019t tremble.\n\n\u2018There and back?\u2019\n\n\u201cYes, there and back.\u2019\n\n\u2018Fully dressed?\u2019\n\n\u2018No, stripped to the waist.\u2019\n\n\u201cWith my trousers and boot on?\u2019\n\nYess\n\nHe pulls his shirt off and throws it to Lucas Egmont,\nand he\u2019s shivering although it\u2019s not in the least cold as he\nstrides down the beach and then wades slowly out into\nthe water. It\u2019s that green moment of twilight when the\nworld is filled with intense light, the night sticks its\ntongue out of its black mouth, and how light it is all\naround it! The surface of the lagoon is like a silken cloth,\nand it rustles almost like silk as the captain wades\nthrough the water. He wades as far as he can before\nstarting to swim, the water is almost up to his shoulders\nwhen he launches himself into his first stroke, and then\nhis head is bobbing up and down in the water like a\nfloating drum, and he dips his forehead into the water\nand there\u2019s just a thick tuft of black hair visible over the\nsurface as he cuts a little black furrow into the green\nwater. Then he starts accelerating, and his boot is\nsplashing away almost over the surface, and when he\u2019s\nabout halfway across the lagoon it happens. The fish\n\n325\n", "must have worked its way underneath him without\nwarning, and all he can manage is a short, stifled shriek\nwhich doesn\u2019t ruffle the smooth surface of the lagoon in\nthe slightest, but just for a moment it rips apart the air\nround about Lucas Egmont and he finds it hard to\nbreathe for a short while. But then the captain\u2019s\nshredded body can\u2019t manage to float any more, his head\ndisappears as quickly as a float after a bite, and all is\ncalm and peaceful. The silken surface of the lagoon has\nbeen slightly rippled, that\u2019s the only glimpse one has of\nthe world\u2019s wounds, but soon it reverts to its smooth,\ngreen, shiny ruthless self.\n15\nNow Lucas Egmont is all alone, more alone than he\u2019s\never been before, even more alone than he\u2019s been when\namong sympathetic people. He throws the captain\u2019s\nshirt out into the lagoon, but regrets that immediately\nand wades out to retrieve it and instead he spreads it out\nover the freezing cold dead body. Then he sits down for\na while beside the white rock, fiddling with the stone,\nand suddenly it occurs to him that neither of them,\nneither the captain nor he himself, had brought that\nstone down the cliff. But somebody must have done so.\nIt can\u2019t have been the English girl, who was definitely\ndown here on the beach after everybody else had\ndispersed: she was too blinded by her double desire, for\nthe dead Jimmie Baaz and the living Boy Larus, to have\nbeen capable of anything of the sort. It can\u2019t have been\nBoy Larus, either: he was too busy trying to make love\nto the English girl. There\u2019s been so sign of Madame, and\nshe looked so strangely vacant from the moment she\n326\n", "spat out all her fear at Tim Solider\u2019s face when he lay\nthere, bitten by the iguanas. Tim Solider. It must have\nbeen Tim Solider. And he remembers that Tim Solider\nwas the only one who seemed to be interested in the lion\nwhen they were sitting arguing round the rock earlier\nin the afternoon; and he picks up the stone and tries to\nfind his footsteps in the sand, but of course, it\u2019s a\nhopeless task when there\u2019s such a confused mass of\nfootprints running off in all directions over the beach.\nThen he suddenly notices something white shining\nthrough the dusk, it\u2019s not far from where the fire was\nand it\u2019s a bird\u2019s feather and then he remembers the flock\nof birds that is still circling over the beach, but less\npurposefully now that it\u2019s started to get dark. He\nthrows the stone away in the direction of the cliffs, and\nwith the feather in his hand he rushes over towards the\ndead bird which hasn\u2019t been sucked out into the open sea\nyet, but is still bouncing backwards and forwards\nbetween its rocks. Then he sees him more or less\nstraight away. He\u2019s hanging at a strange angle, with his\nhead pointing downwards and one foot just under the\nsurface, trapped in a little crevice, and he\u2019s fallen\nforwards and broken his foot so that his body is hanging\ndown vertically. He takes a firm hold of the foot and\ntries to prise it loose, but it\u2019s well and truly hooked and\nit\u2019s incredibly difficult to do anything about it. Eventu-\nally, he gives an enormous tug and it comes loose, but he\nhasn\u2019t reckoned with how fantastically heavy the body\nis, and he loses his grip and the corpse sinks so fast and so\ndeep that he has no chance of grabbing it again.\n\nIt\u2019s still grass-green dusk when he makes his way\nback, and he\u2019s unhappy in quite a new way. There\u2019s\nnothing he can do about it, but there\u2019s a persistent little\nworry nagging away at first one corner and then\n\n327\n", "another of his confidence, and in the end he lies down by\nthe dead fire and tries to work out what\u2019s what. He\nreally can\u2019t find anything to console him, and after lying\nthere for a while he gets up and goes back to the rock\nwhich is now gleaming like a magic charm in the darker\ntwilight; and he\u2019s sure so much struggling can\u2019t have\nbeen in vain, there must have been some point, the point\nmust be that he should finish off things, including what\nTim Solider wanted to help him with: he must carve\nthat lion, his own and Tim\u2019s lion, before it gets even\ndarker. He searches for the stone and then he lies down\nbeside the rock in a comfortable posture and he can hear\nfrom the sound of the sea and the flight of the birds and\nthe walk of the iguanas how intimate night is preparing\nto make its entrance.\n\n- and that\u2019s when the terrible thing happens. He\u2019s\nraring to go, he\u2019s holding the stone tightly in his hand,\nhe\u2019s lying in the right position by the rock, and it\u2019s not\ntoo dark for him not to be able to make out every detail\nin his carving for some time yet, everything\u2019s as it\nshould be and he\u2019s been fighting to overcome all doubt\nand all doubt has been overcome, and even so, a terrible\nthing like this can happen: all of a sudden, he can\u2019t\nremember whata lion looks like, and the captain\u2019s lion,\nthe only model, is lying dead on the bottom of the\ndreadful lagoon.\n\nOh, how he struggles to remember: he rolls around in\nthe sand, he lies still in the sand and closes his eyes and\ntries to set the stone tracing lovingly round a shadow he\nremembers from his childhood, a lion on a circus poster,\na lion in a zoology textbook; he tries to draw in the sand\nbut the result is so awful that he bites at the sand in fury\ntill he has a mouth full of sand and is choking and\ncoughing and, blinded by the sand, he staggers around\n\n328\n", "the beach and bumps into the cliff, falls on his knees in\nthe water, stumbles over the burnt-out fire, falls over\nthe white rock, and for one horrible moment grabs hold\nof the dead body and when he realizes what it is he\nshrieks like a lunatic and swallows the sand and rushes\nup towards the cliff face and stands there with his back\nto it and gapes around in all directions with his wild,\nstill half-blind eyes, as if trying to protect himself from\nthe most awful thing of all.\n\nThat\u2019s when the lions appear. With swishing tails and\nmanes scattering rain and sand, they come thundering\ndown the beach and stand roaring in front of him.\nThere\u2019s an enormous mass of lions, the whole beach is\nfull of them, indeed, no doubt the whole island, for now\nhe can hear the swishing tails and fluttering manes high\nabove his head and he curls up until he\u2019s the most\ninsignificant of nonentities and in fact they don\u2019t seem\nall that interested in him, they swing round in the sand\nin front of him and the dust rises like a cloud and blinds\nhim completely, they leap out roaring into the water,\nshowing no respect in their bellies for the sharp fish, and\nthey snort like horses in the water and when they come\nback again they shake themselves so carelessly that he\u2019s\nsoaked and then they suddenly come racing down from\nthe cliff and jump over him and land with their horrific\nlimbs so close to him that his whole mouth is filled with\nsand and he bends forward and vomits convulsively and\nhis head is a roundabout of roaring, panting, snorting\nand bellowing from unfortunate animals on the island\nwhich have got into the most awful mess and as he lies\nthere vomiting a dribbling lion stands astride him and\ngrowls with its upper lip curled threateningly and the\nstink from its dirty, predatory teeth envelopes him in a\nstifling cloud. If only they\u2019d go away, if only they\u2019d go\n\n329\n", "away again, now he knows everything about lions and,\nwith both eyes closed, he draws one lion after another in\nthe air around him until his arm is bitten off, and\nactually he doesn\u2019t have his eyes closed although he\nthinks he has, it\u2019s just that he\u2019s blinded by the sand and\nby fear.\n\nSuddenly everything is ghostly silent, and all at once\nhe can see again although that\u2019s what he wants least just\nnow, and what he\u2019s forced to see while his blood and life\nare running out of him through the hole where his\nbitten-off arm was is the most terrible thing in the\nwhole world. One of the lions has been down to the\nbottom of the lagoon and sniffed out the drowned\ncaptain and now he\u2019s sitting quite still on the lion\u2019s back,\nblue in the face and with motionless, staring eyes and his\nhair sticking down over his forehead like a horn, and,\npainfully slowly, they\u2019re coming towards Lucas Egmont.\nGet down on your knees, whispers the dead mouth, and\nhe kneels down and screams the second before the lion\ngives him that fatal blow on his head, \u201cYou won, you\nwere the winner, I give in.\u2019\n\nBut suddenly the world seems to have been trans-\nformed, and he\u2019s reincarnated as a young male lion,\nbristling with life and eagerness; he races up the cliff\nand then leaps down again in death-defying abandon,\nwhipping up the sand with his frenzied rutting dance;\neffortlessly and playfully he knocks down the young\nlioness which playfully bites him in return for his\nboldness, and as the stars explode and the roars of the\nlions rip him apart and he them, night falls and stifles\neverything in its narcotic embrace. Its mask settles over\neveryone and everything, and now comes deep, terrible,\nliberating sleep.\n\n330\n", "16\n\nHe wakes up and it\u2019s still night and a handful of distant\nstars are trying in vain to come closer. He stretches, and\nrealizes from the darkness and the silence that he\u2019s at the\nbottom of the world. Indeed, Lucas Egmont is at the\nbottom of the world, because the fact is, you can\u2019t just\nkeep on falling for ever; the ego has an endless\nsuccession of glass roofs, but under the lowest of them is\na bottom, a haven for the seeker, for a seeker about\nwhom they said he\u2019d go far when he was little, but all\nhe\u2019s done is sink, deeper and deeper - right to the\nbottom.\n\nAt the bottom of the world, it\u2019s big and hot and silent,\nbut not so big and hot and silent that anybody who\u2019s\nfallen can\u2019t make himself at home and feel comfortable\nfor the brief moment he\u2019s there. When you're at the\nbottom of the world, you can ask every question and\nthink every thought without needing to be afraid of the\nunknown, giddying depths beneath you. The bottom of\nthe world is free from fear in that it\u2019s the secure bottom\nfor all fear, and free from fear in that anyone who\u2019s\nlanded up there is already familiar with all kinds of fear:\nthe fear of death, the fear of cramp, the fear of hunger,\nthe fear of a cycling accident and a sharp scythe, the fear\nof falling and the fear of landing in the ditch, the fear of\nthe market square and fear of the hearse and all the\nother fears that adorn the whole of the way from the\nbottom of the world to its surface. But the bottom of\nthe world is also free from many other things: it\u2019s free\nfrom love and free from hatred and free from guilt and\nfree from happiness, free from hope and free from\n\n331\n", "disappointment, because on the way there the seeker\nhas peeled off everything that adorned or disfigured\nhim and now he\u2019s completely naked, more naked than\never before, he has neither the swimming trunks of\ndoubt nor the bath-robe of hope to hide behind, but it\u2019s\nnot too dark for him to contemplate himself and see\nwhat he looks like without any kind of disguise, without\nany mask, and on that basis he can fix his position in the\nworld, even though he\u2019s already dead and, with closed\neyes, can observe the place where the drowning\nhappened.\n\nWhat I want is to do what\u2019s right, he thinks, I want to\ndo all I can to carry out the rightest of right actions.\nEverybody goes on about doing the right thing, they\ntake it so seriously, they go on about the man who does\nthe right thing, but how can anybody be so cruel as to\noverlook the man who tries to do the right thing but is\ninterrupted at the wrong time? What about the\ncharacter who gets cut off by a stammer or an epilectic\nfit with fatal consequences, or the bloke who just\nforgets something: he can\u2019t remember what a lion looks\nlike while it\u2019s still light, and before it gets really dark\nthe beach is suddenly filled with lions that demonstrate\nexactly what a lion looks like and while there\u2019s still a\nchance of doing the right thing, of carving the image of\nthe lion into the white rock, one of those lions bites off\nthe only arm that can perform the only right thing, and\nthen all of a sudden he\u2019s in possession again of not only\nhis arm but also the memory of what a lion looks like,\nbut by that time it\u2019s so dark there\u2019s nothing to be done.\nIs there any salvation for him? Oh yes, there just has to\nbe some form of salvation, if you can talk about\nsalvation rather than foundering. Maybe neither of\nthose are appropriate. Why should we succumb, come\n\n332\n", "to that, and how should we go about succumbing if we\ndon\u2019t believe in some punitive supreme being above all\nother supreme beings? But otherwise, of course, it\nwould fit in with our immoral world order if it weren't\nsufficient to put up with your pleasures and your\nproblems while you're alive, but even later as well. It\nwould fit in just perfectly with the Justice envisaged by\nour world order, with her miserable expression, and the\nbrutal iron mask superimposed on the face twisted by\ndesire.\n\nWhat a splendid idea, that we should be judged\naccording to whether we do right or wrong! There are\nso few of our actions we have control over. Pure\nchance, which can be distinguished from pure justice\nonly because as yet it hasn\u2019t got any bandages on, sets off\nand rounds off our actions; and what we can do and of\ncourse ought to do and indeed must do because of our\nconscience, whose very existence is so often queried, is\nto let ourselves be propelled in a particular direction,\nand how stubbornly we cling to that direction. But we\nknow thanks to the most wide-open of all the world\u2019s\nwide-open eyes that, as often as not, the goal is an\nillusion, and the important thing is the direction,\nbecause that and that alone is what we have control\nover. And awareness, oh yes, awareness: the open eyes\nwhich fearlessly scrutinize their dangerous position\nmust be the stars of our ego, our only compass, the\ncompass which decides which direction we take,\nbecause if there is no compass, there can be no direction.\nBut if I put my trust in the direction, I have to question\nstatements about human wickedness, because within a\ndirection which might well be splendid in itself, there\ncan be tendencies for both good and evil.\n\nJust as you could say man has a natural tendency\n\n333\n", "towards evil, you could also say man has a natural\ntendency towards good, an irresistible urge to be good\nwhich can sometimes land him in ridiculous situations.\nI, Lucas Egmont, have naturally had to face up to both\nwhat they call good and evil within me. Once I'd been\nout fishing, and had to catch the last train home, or else\nbe faced with several miles\u2019 walk: I was late, and I could\nhear the train chugging down the valley. Then I came\nacross some little children looking for some house or\nother, I could hear them as I ran past on the road, but I\nwas in such a hurry I couldn\u2019t possibly think of stopping;\nbut as I approached the station, my pangs of conscience\nrose up like swelling lumps in my chest and when I got\nto the platform just as the train was steaming in, my\nstupid sense of kindness forced me to retrace my steps\nand help them to find their way, but just as we were\nabout to say goodbye, the boy said something innocent\nwhich made me see red and I boxed his ears and his nose\nstarted bleeding and he screamed as if he\u2019d been\nstabbed, but I really enjoyed it because I\u2019d managed to\nmake up for my paradoxical kindness via my para-\ndoxical wickedness. I don\u2019t want to go along with the\ndistinction between good and evil actions or even that\nbetween right and wrong actions, but just that between\ncontrolled and uncontrolled actions, conscious and\nunconscious actions; and since the most important thing\nis to maintain the direction aiming at the final goal, or\nindeed the more or less invisible goal, that is in fact the\nmain distinction between controlled and uncontrolled\nactions.\n\nAs we\u2019re not alone in the world, or at least, not as\nalone as we'd like to be, we have an obligation to keep\nour explosions under control, to let our unavoidable\nexplosions of paradoxical wickedness or paradoxical\n", "goodness proceed in the approximate direction of the\napproximate goal. As far as the goal is concerned, it\nmay not be so desperately important so pin it down with\nthe same sadistic precision as the one with which the\nworld order and pure chance form a fascinating\npartnership and pin down the human condition in time\nand space. Of course, we have to fight about both those\nconcepts, and since the most important thing is the right\ndirection aimed at the possibly false goal, we need to\nsharpen our awareness until it becomes as sharp as a\nsword-blade, and sharp as an arrow-head supplemented\nby the brutal strength of a drill. Then our conscience\noperates in our consciousness, which is after all just an\nidyllic description of our fear, for our fear reminds us\nconstantly of the right direction, and if we stifle our\nfear, we also lose the opportunity of directing our\nthoughts in a particular direction and we give vent to a\nseries of stupid private explosions, first here and then\nthere, which give rise to the greatest possible damage\nand the least possible result. That\u2019s why we must keep\nour fear alive within us, like an ice-free harbour which\ncan always help us to survive the winter. The bubbling\nundercurrent beneath the winter floods.\n\nUntil I found my direction, I was living like an\nirresponsible freelance dynamiter who could feel guilt\nbut had no idea how to expiate it. I was like a live bomb\nwhich could go off at any time, and not even I\nunderstood how it worked or when it would explode, I\nwas just floating around like a fleck of soot ina gutter. I\nembezzled money from the bank in a completely\nmeaningless fashion, I landed on that boat at Ronton just\nas pointlessly, and I emptied our communal water\nsupply driven by the ridiculous straw of the freelance\ndynamiter: being faithful to your little distress.\n", "But it was only when we'd discovered the white rock\nand the struggle over the lion began that my real life\nstarted. Only then did I acquire a direction towards a\ngoal that was incontestably attainable, but in the end it\ndidn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s the struggle that counts and\nnot the goal, and because it\u2019s the joy of the struggle and\nnot the joy of the goal that prevents you from going\nunder, for there is a \u2018going under\u2019, even if it\u2019s not\nsomething concrete: going under is to live unawares and\ndie happy without having struggled to achieve a\nmeaningless goal, going under is to die calmly and\npeacefully without having put up meaningless resistance\nto the great meaninglessness of the world, going under\nis to spread your explosions over the enormous firing\nrange of chance, going under is to shout like Lucas\nEgmont did then: I shall be faithful to my thirst, but\nunfaithful to everything else; or like somebody else: I\nshall be faithful to my hunger, but unfaithful to\neverything else; or like a third person: I shall be faithful\nto my sex, but unfaithful to everything else; or like\nsome other person: I shall be faithful to my obedience,\nbut unfaithful to everything else; or like this one: I shall\nbe faithful to my paralysis, but unfaithful to everything\nelse; or that: I shall be faithful to my longing but\nunfaithful to everything else; or again: I shall be faithful\nto my grief, but unfaithful to everything else; or finally:\nI shall be faithful to my fear, but unfaithful to\neverything else.\n\nNo, the only possibility is to say: I shall be faithful to\nmy direction and faithful to everything within it: my\nfear, my hunger, my thirst, my despair, my grief, my\nlonging, my paralysis, my sex, my hatred, my death. Oh\nyes, within my direction I shall be so faithful to my\ndeath that without so much as a shudder, but in grateful\n\n336\n", "diffidence towards the fact that I\u2019ve been allowed to\nlive, I shall be able to walk down the beach, wade\nslowly out into the water, and there -\n17\n\nAnd he walks down the beach and the sand is soft and\nwarm and so far his toes wallow in it, full of longing,\nbut now he\u2019s come to the firm, wet sand which cools his\nburning, naked soles like a drink. And he continues\nslowly into the water and feels its cool softness rising\nover his feet, burying his feet, burying his ankles, slowly\nrising like a cool and merciful breeze up his legs, his\nkneecaps hover on the surface before sinking and the\nwater licks his loins like a soft, rough tongue, the soft,\nrough tongue of death. And the water rises over all his\nmemories of all his cool moments and all his hot\nmoments, over all the burning words whispered just at\nthe moment when... And the water ripples gently up\nhis stomach and moistens the thirsty little mouth of his\nnavel and his rib cage, rising and falling, suddenly finds\nitself enclosed in a much bigger, a much softer cage, and\nthe tiny tips of his nipples suck at the surface, then\ncomes his neck with its elegant little hollow as if made\nfor water to trickle into, and his Adam\u2019s apple which he\ndoesn\u2019t need any more because all his screams have\nalready been screamed gives in without protest to the\ndesires of the lagoon, and already a little wave is lapping\nagainst his chin, it comes out of the darkness and rolls on\ninto the darkness behind him, and his chin sinks and his\nmouth kisses the water and they are just as delightfully\ncool, it and his mouth, and suddenly he\u2019s swimming. His\nlegs and his trunk and his shoulders and his head rise\n", "gently from the darkness of the bottom to the darkness\nof the surface and his arms become wings and his body\nglides silently like a boat with raised oars through the\ngentle water and his ear which is resting on the water\nline suddenly hears the slight splashing sound from the\nbottom far beneath him and his eye which is leaning out\nover the blind surface of the lagoon fancies it can see the\nrapid change from green light to black light down\nbelow and he glides forward a few more inches before\nit\u2019s all over, before he\u2019s ceased to exist, ceased to exist\nfor everyone and everything apart from the water fora\nshort while, but a memory lives on a little longer at a\ncertain bank, among a few pale counter clerks, ina man\nhe used to buy illegal cigarettes from, a girl with sweaty\narmpits but healthy teeth who used to come up to his\nroom on Wednesdays and share his bed, among a few\niguanas he had come across on an island, and perhaps as\nthe sharpest memory of all in the sword of the fish\nwhose tigerish shadow is just now roaring up towards\nhim - and then: finis.\n338\n"]

["CHAPTER I\nA BIRD\u2019S-EYE VIEW OF STOCKHOLM\n\nIr was an evening in the beginning of May. The\nlittle garden on \u2018\u2018 Moses Height,\u201d on the south side\nof the town had not yet been thrown open to the\npublic, and the flower-beds were still unturned.\n\u2018The snowdrops had worked through the accumulations\nof last year\u2019s dead leaves, and were on the point of clos-\ning their short career and making room for the crocuses\nwhich had found shelter under a barren pear tree ;\nthe elder was waiting for a southerly wind before\nbursting into bloom, but the tightly closed buds of\nthe limes still offered cover for love-making to the\nchaffinches, busily employed in building their lichen-\ncovered nests between trunk and branch. No human\nfoot had trod the gravel paths since last winter\u2019s\nsnow had melted, and the free and easy life of beasts\nand flowers was left undisturbed. The sparrows\nindustriously collected all manner of rubbish, and\nstowed it away under the tiles of the Navigation\nSchool. They burdened themselves with scraps of\nthe rocket-cases of last autumn\u2019s fireworks, and\npicked the straw covers off the young trees, trans-\nplanted from the nursery in the Deer Park only a\nyear ago\u2014nothing escaped them. They discovered\nshreds of muslin in the summer arbours; the\nsplintered leg of a seat supplied them with tufts of\nhair left on the battlefield by dogs which had not\nbeen fighting there since Josephine\u2019s day. What a\nlife it was !\n\nThe sun was standing over the Liljeholm, throwing\nsheaves of rays towards the east; they pierced the\n\n1 A\n", "columns of smoke of Bergsund, flashed across the\nRiddarfj\u00e9rd, climbed to the cross of the Riddarholms\nchurch, flung themselves on to the steep roof of the\nGerman church opposite, toyed with the bunting\ndisplayed by the boats on the pontoon bridge,\nsparkled in the windows of the chief custom-house,\nilluminated the woods of the Liding Island, and dicd\naway in a rosy cloud far, far away in the distance\nwhere the sea was. And from thence the wind came\nand travelled back by the same way, over Vaxholm,\npast the fortress, past the custom-house and along\nthe Sikla Island, forcing its way in behind the\nHastarholm, glancing at the summer resorts ; then\nout again and on, on to the hospital Daniken ; there\nit took fright and dashed away in a headlong career\nalong the southern shore, noticed the smell of coal,\ntar and fish-oil, came dead against the city quay,\nrushed up to Moses Height, swept into the garden\nand buffeted against a wall.\n\nThe wall was opened by a maidservant, who, at\nthe very moment, was engaged in peeling off the\npaper pasted over the chinks of the double windows ;\na terrible smell of dripping, beer dregs, pine needles,\nand sawdust poured out and was carried away by\nthe wind, while the maid stood breathing the fresh\nair through her nostrils. It plucked the cotton-wool,\nstrewn with barberry berries, tinsel and rose leaves,\nfrom the space between the windows and danced it\nalong the paths, joined by sparrows and chaffinches\nwho saw here the solution of the greater part of their\nhousing problem.\n\nMeanwhile, the maid continued her work at the\ndouble windows ; in a few minutes the door leading\nfrom the restaurant stood open, and a man, well but\nplainly dressed, stepped out into the garden. There\nwas nothing striking about his face beyond a slight\nexpression of care and worry which disappeared as\nsoon as he had emerged from the stuffy room and\ncaught sight of the wide horizon. He turned to the\nside from whence the wind came, opened his overcoat,\n", "and repeatedly drew a deep breath which seemed\nto relieve his heart and lungs. Then he began to\nstroll up and down the barrier which separated the\ngarden from the cliffs in the direction of the sea.\n\nFar below him lay the noisy, reawakening town ;\nthe steam cranes whirred in the harbour, the iron\nbars rattled in the iron weighing machine, the\nwhistles of the lock-keepers shrilled, the steamers at\nthe pontoon bridge smoked, the omnibuses rumbled\nover the uneven paving-stones; noise and uproar\nin the fish market, sails and flags on the water outside ;\nthe screams of the sea-gulls, bugle-calls from the\ndockyard, the turning out of the guard, the clattering\nof the wooden shoes of the working-men\u2014all this\nproduced an impression of life and bustle, which\nseemed to rouse the young man\u2019s energy; his face\nassumed an expression of defiance, cheerfulness and\nresolution, and as he leaned over the barrier and\nlooked at the town below, he seemed to be watching\nan enemy; his nostrils expanded, his eyes flashed,\nand he raised his clenched fist as if he were challenging\nor threatening the poor town.\n\nThe bells of St. Catherine\u2019s chimed seven; the\nsplenetic treble of St. Mary\u2019s seconded ; the basses\nof the great church, and the German church joined\nin, and soon the air was vibrating with the sound\nmade by the seven bells of the town ; then one after\nthe other relapsed into silence, until far away in the\ndistance only the last one of them could be heard\nsinging its peaceful evensong ; it had a higher note,\na purer tone and a quicker tempo than the others\u2014\nyes, it had! He listened and wondered whence the\nsound came, for it seemed to stir up vague memories\nin him. All of a sudden his face relaxed and his\nfeatures expressed the misery of a forsaken child.\nAnd he was forsaken; his father and mother were\nlying in the churchyard of St. Clara\u2019s, from whence\nthe bell could still be heard; and he was a child;\n7 Sa believed in everything, truth and fairy tales\nalike.\n", "The bell of St. Clara\u2019s was silent, and the sound of\nfootsteps on the gravel path roused him from his\nreverie. A short man with side-whiskers came to-\nwards him from the verandah ; he wore spectacles,\napparently more for the sake of protecting his glances\nthan his eyes, and his malicious mouth was generally\ntwisted into a kindly, almost benevolent, expression.\nHe was dressed in a neat overcoat with defective\nbuttons, a somewhat battered hat, and trousers\nhoisted at half-mast. His walk indicated assurance\nas well as timidity. His whole appearance was so\nindefinite that it was impossible to guess at his\nage or social position. He might just as well have\nbeen an artisan as a government official; his age\nwas anything between twenty-nine and forty-five\nyears. He was obviously flattered to find himself\nin the company of the man whom he had come to\nmeet, for he raised his bulging hat with unusual\nceremony and smiled his kindliest smile.\n\n\u2018*T hope you haven\u2019t been waiting, assessor ? \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cNot for a second; it\u2019s only just struck seven.\nThank you for coming. I must confess that this\nmeeting is of the greatest importance to me ; I might\nalmost say it concerns my whole future, Mr. Struve.\u201d\n\n\u2018** Bless me! Do you mean it?\u201d\n\nMr. Struve blinked ; he had come to drink a glass\nof toddy and was very little inclined for a serious\nconversation. He had his reasons for that.\n\n\u2018** We shall be more undisturbed if we have our toddy\noutside, if you don\u2019t mind,\u201d continued the assessor.\n\nMr. Struve stroked his right whisker, put his hat\ncarefully on his head and thanked the assessor for his\ninvitation ; but he looked uncasy.\n\n\u201cTo begin with, I must ask you to drop the\n\u2018assessor,\u2019 began the young man. \u201cI\u2019ve never\nbeen more than a regular assistant, and I cease to be\neven that from to-day ; I\u2019m Mr. Falk, nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201c* What ?\u201d\n\nMr. Struve looked as if he had lost a distinguished\nfriend, but he kept his temper.\n", "** You\u2019re a man with liberal tendencies. . . .\u201d\n\nMr. Struve tried to explain himself, but Falk\ncontinued :\n\n\u201c*T asked you to meet me here in your character\nof contributor to the liberal Red Cap.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood heavens! I\u2019m such a very unimportant\ncontributor. . . .\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* I\u2019ve read your thundering articles on the working\nman\u2019s question, and all other questions which nearly\nconcern us. We\u2019re in the year three, in Roman\nfigures, for it is now the third year of the new\nParliament, and soon our hopes will have become\nrealities. I\u2019ve read your excellent biographies of our\nleading politicians in the Peasant\u2019s Friend, the\nlives of those men of the people, who have at last been\nallowed to voice what oppressed them for so long ;\nyou\u2019re a man of progress and I\u2019ve a great respect for\nyou.\u201d\n\nStruve, whose eyes had grown dull instead of\nkindling at the fervent words, seized with pleasure\nthe proffered safety-valve.\n\n\u201cFS must admit,\u201d he said eagerly, \u201c\u2018that I\u2019m\nimmensely pleased to find myself appreciated by a\nyoung and\u2014I must say it\u2014excellent man like you,\nassessor ; but, on the other hand, why talk of such\ngrave, not to say sad things, when we\u2019re sitting\nhere, in the lap of nature, on the first day of spring,\nwhile all the buds are bursting and the sun is pouring\nhis warmth on the whole creation! Let\u2019s snap our\nfingers at care and drink our glass in peace. Excuse\nme\u2014lI believe I\u2019m your senior\u2014and\u2014I venture\u2014to\nan therefore... .\u201d\n\nalk, who like a flint had gone out in search of steel,\n\u2018realized that he had struck wood. He accepted the\nproposal without eagerness. And the new brothers\nsat side by side, and all they had to tell each\n\u2014 was the disappointment expressed in their\naces.\n\n\u201c\u201cT mentioned a little while ago,\u201d Falk resumed,\n\u201cthat I\u2019ve broken to-day with my past life and\n", "thrown up my career as a government employ\u00e9,\nI'll only add that I intend taking up literature.\u201d\n\n\u2018** Literature ? Good Heavens! Why? Oh, but\nthat 7s a pity!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t ; but I want you to tell me how to set\nabout finding work.\u201d\n\n\u201cTm! That\u2019s really difficult to say. The pro-\nfession is crowded with so many people of all sorts.\nBut you mustn\u2019t think of it. It really is a pity to\nspoil your career; the literary profession is a bad\none.\u201d .\n\nStruve looked sorry, but he could not hide a certain\nsatisfaction at having met a friend in misfortune.\n\n\u2018* But tell me,\u201d he continued, \u201c\u2018 Why are you throw-\ning up a eareer which promises a man honours as\nwell as influence ?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201c Honours to those who have usurped the power,\nand influence to the most unscrupulous.\u201d\n\n\u201cStuff! It isn\u2019t really as bad as all that ?\u201d\n\n*\u201cIsn\u2019t it ? Well, then I must speak more plainly.\nT\u2019ll show you the inner working of one of the six\ndepartments for which I had put down. The first\nfive I left at once for the very simple reason that\nthere was no room for me. Whenever I went and\nasked whether there was anything for me to do, I\nwas told No! And I never saw anybody doing any-\nthing. And that was in the busy departments, like\nthe Committee on Brandy Distilleries, the Direct\nTaxation Office and The Board of Administration of\nEmploy\u00e9s\u2019 Pensions. But when I noticed the swarm-\ning crowd of officials, the idea struck me that the\ndepartment which had to pay out all the salaries\nmust surely be very busy indeed. I therefore put\nmy name down for the Board of Payment of Employ\u00e9s\u2019\nSalaries.\u201d\n\n** And did you go there ?\u201d\u2019 asked Struve, beginning\nto feel interested.\n\n\u2018* Yes. I shall never forget the great impression\nmade on me by my visit to this thoroughly well-\norganized department. I went there at cleven\n", "o\u2019clock one morning, because this is supposed to be\nthe time when the offices open. In the waiting-room\nI found two young messengers sprawling on a table.\non their stomachs, reading the Fatherland.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe \u2018 Fatherland\u2019 ?\u201d\n\nStruve, who had up to the present been feeding\nthe sparrows with sugar, pricked up his ears.\n\n\u201c\u201cYes. I said \u2018good morning.\u2019 A feeble wriggling\nof the gentlemen\u2019s backs indicated that they accepted\nmy good morning without any decided displeasure ;\none of them even went to the length of waggling the\nheel of his right foot, which might have been intended\nas a substitute for a handshake. I asked whether\neither of the gentlemen were disengaged and could\nshow me the offices. Both of them declared that\nthey were unable to do so, because their orders were\nnot to leave the waiting-room. I inquired whether\nthere were any other messengers. Yes, there were\nothers. But the chief messenger was away on a\nholiday ; the first messenger was on leave; the\nsecond was not on duty; the third had gone to the\npost ; the fourth was ill; the fifth had gone to fetch\nsome drinking water; the sixth was in the yard\n\u2018where he remained all day long\u2019; moreover, no\nofficial ever arrived before one o\u2019clock. This was a\nhint to me that my early, inconvenient visit was not\ngood form, and at the same time a reminder that the\nmessengers, also, were government employ\u00e9s.\n\n** But when I stated that I was firmly resolved on\nseeing the offices, so as to gain an idea of the division\nof labour in so important and comprehensive a\ndepartment, the younger of the two consented to\ncome with me. When he opened the door I had a\nmagnificent view of a suite of sixteen rooms of various\nsizes. There must be work here, I thought, con-\ngratulating myself on my happy idea of coming.\nThe crackling of sixteen birchwood fires in sixteen\ntiled stoves interrupted in the pleasantest manner\nthe solitude of the place.\u201d\n\nStruve, who had become more and more interested\n", "fumbled for a pencil between the material and lining\nof his waistcoat, and wrote \u201c16\u201d on his left cuff.\n\n\u201c\u201cThis is the adjuncts\u2019 room,\u2019 explained the\nmessenger.\n\n\u201c\u201cT see! Are there many adjuncts in this depart-\nment ?\u2019 I asked.\n\n*<\u00abQOh, yes! More than enough!\u2019 \u201d\n\n** \u00abWhat do they do all day long ?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! They write, of course, a little... .\u2019\u201d\n\n*\u201c* He was speaking familiarly, so that I thought it\ntime to interrupt him. After wandering through the\ncopyists\u2019, the notaries\u2019, the clerk\u2019s, the controller\u2019s\nand his seerctary\u2019s, the reviser\u2019s and his secretary\u2019s,\nthe public prosecutor\u2019s, the registrar of the ex-\nchequer\u2019s, the master of the rolls\u2019 and the librarian\u2019s,\nthe treasurer\u2019s, the cashier\u2019s, the procurator\u2019s, the\nprotonotary\u2019s, the keeper of the minutes\u2019, the\nactuary\u2019s, the keeper of the records\u2019, the seeretary\u2019s,\nthe first clerk\u2019s, and the head of the department\u2019s\nrooms, we came to a door which bore in gilt letters the\nwords: \u2018'The President.\u2019 I was going to open the\ndoor but the messenger stopped me; genuincly\nuneasy, he seized my arm and whispered: \u2018 Shsh!\u2019\n\u2014\u2018Is he asleep ?\u2019 I asked, my thoughts busy with\nan old rumour. \u2018 For God\u2019s sake, be quiet! No one\nmay enter here unless the president rings the bell.\u2019\n\u201cDoes he often ring?\u2019 \u2018No, I\u2019ve never heard him\nringing in my time, and I\u2019ve been here twelve\nmonths.\u2019 He was again inclined to be familiar, so\nI said no more.\n\n\u2018* About noon the adjuncts began to arrive, and to\nmy amazement I found in them nothing but old\nfriends from the Committee on Brandy Distillcries,\nand the Board of Administration of Employ\u00e9s\u2019\nPensions. My amazement grew when the registrar\nfrom the Inland Revenue Office strolled into the\nactuary\u2019s room, and made himself as comfortable in\nhis easy-chair as he used to do in the Inland Revenue\nOffice.\n\n**T took one of the young men aside and asked him\n", "whether it would not be advisable for me to call on\nthe president. \u2018Shsh!\u2019 was his mysterious reply,\nwhile he took me into room No. 8. Again this\nmysterious shsh !\n\n\u201c*The room which we had just entered was quite as\ndark as the rest of them, but it was much dirtier.\nThe horsehair stuffing was bursting through the-\nleather covering of the furniture ; thick dust lay on\nthe writing-table; by the side of an inkstand, in\nwhich the ink had dried long ago, lay an unused\nstick of sealing-wax with the former owner\u2019s name\nmarked on it in Anglo-Saxon letters; in addition\nthere was a pair of paper shears whose blades were\nheld together by rust; a date rack which had not\nbeen turned since midsummer five years ago; a\nState directory five years old; a sheet of blotting-\npaper with Julius Cesar, Julius Cesar, Julius Cesar\nwritten all over it, a hundred times at least, alter-\nnating with as many Father Noahs. :\n\n\u201c\u201c*This is the office of the Master of the Rolls; we\nshall be undisturbed here,\u2019 said my friend.\n\n*** Tjoesn\u2019t the Master of the Rolls come here, then ?\u2019\nIT asked.\n\n\u00ab \u00abWe hasn\u2019t been here these five years, and now\nhe\u2019s ashamed to turn up.\u2019\n\n\u201c** But who does his work ?\u2019\n\n*** The librarian.\u2019\n\n\u00ab\u00ab\u00ab But what is his work in a department like the\nBoard of Payment of Employ\u00e9s\u2019 Salaries ? \u2019\n\n\u201c\u201c\u00ab'The messengers sort the receipts, chronologically\nand alphabetically, and send them to the book-\nbinders ; the librarian supervises their being placed\non shelves specially adapted for the purpose.\u2019 \u201d\u2019\n\nThe conversation now seemed to amuse Struve ;\nhe scribbled a word every now and then on his cuff,\nand as Falk paused he thought it incumbent on him\nto ask an important question.\n\n\u201cBut how did the Master of the Rolls get his\nsalary ?\u201d\n\n**It was sent to his private address. Wasn\u2019t that\n", "simple enough ? However, my young friend advised\nme to present mysclf to the actuary and ask him to\nintroduce me to the other employ\u00e9s who were now\ndropping in to poke the fires in their tiled stoves and\nenjoy the last glimmer of the glowing wood. My\nfriend told me that the actuary was an influential\nand good-natured individual, very susceptible to little\ncourtesies.\n\n\u201cI, who had come across. him in his character as\nRegistrar of the Exchequer, had formed a different\nopinion of him, but believing that my friend knew\nbetter, I went to see him.\n\n\u00abThe redoubtable actuary sat in a capacious ecasy-\nchair with his feet on a reindeer skin. He was\nengaged in seasoning a real meerschaum pipe, sewn\nup in soft leather. So as not to appear idle, he\nwas glancing at yesterday\u2019s Post, acquainting\nhimself in this way with the wishes of the Govern-\nment.\n\n\u201cMy entrance seemed to annoy him; he pushed\nhis spectacles on to his bald head; hiding his right\neye behind the edge of the newspaper, he shot a conical\nbullet at me with the left. I proffered my request.\nHe took the mouthpiece of his meerschaum into his\nright hand and examined it to find out how far he had\ncoloured it. The dreadful silence which followed\nconfirmed my apprchensions. He cleared his throat ;\nthere was a loud, hissing noise in the heap of glowing\ncoal. Then he remembered the newspaper and con-\ntinued his perusal of it. I judged it wise to repeat\nmy request in a different form. He lost his temper.\n\u2018What the devil do you want ? What are you doing\nin my room? Can\u2019t I have peace in my own\nquarters ? What? Get out, get out, get out! sir,\nI say! Can\u2019t you see that I\u2019m busy. Go to the\nprotonotary if you want anything! Don\u2019t come here\nbothering me !\u2019\n\n\u00abIT went to the protonotary.\n\n\u201cThe Committee of Supplics was sitting; it had\nbeen sitting for three Bo already. The protono-\n", "tary was in the chair and three clerks were keeping the\nminutes. The samples sent in by the purveyors lay\nscattered about on the tables, round which all dis-\nengaged clerks, copyists and notaries were assembled.\nIn spite of much diversity of opinion, it had been\nagreed\u2019 to order twenty reams of Lessebo paper, and\nafter repeatedly testing their cutting capacity, the\npurchase of forty-eight pairs of Grantorp scissors,\nwhich had been awarded a prize, had been decided\non. (The actuary held twenty-five shares in this\nconcern.) \u2018The test writing with the steel nibs had\ntaken a whole week, and the minutes concerning it\nhad taken up two reams of paper. It was now the\nturn of the penknives, and the committee was intent\non testing them on the leaves of the black table.\n\n***] propose ordering Sheffield doubleblades No. 4,\nwithout a corkscrew,\u2019 said the protonotary, cutting\na splinter off the table large enough to light a fire\nwith. What does the first notary say ?\u2019\n\n\u201cThe first notary, who had cut too deeply into the\ntable, had come across a nail and damaged an\nEskilstuna No. 2, with three blades, suggested buying\nthe latter.\n\n\u00ab After everybody had given his opinion and alleged\nreasons for holding it, adding practical tests, the\nchairman suggested buying two gross of Sheffields.\n\n\u201c But the first notary protested, and delivered a long\nspeech, which was taken down on record, copied out\ntwice, registered, sorted (alphabetically and chrono-\nlogically), bound and placed by the messenger\u2014\nunder the librarian\u2019s supervision\u2014on a spccially\nadapted shelf. This protest displayed a warm,\n\u201csee feeling; its principal object was the\n\nemonstration of the necessity of encouraging home\nindustries.\n\n\u201cBut this being equivalent to a charge brought\nagainst the Government\u2014secing that it was brought\nagainst one of its employ\u00e9s\u2014the protonotary felt it\nhis duty to meet it. He started with a historical\ndigression on the origin of the discount on manu-\n", "factured goods\u2014at the word discount all the adjuncts\npricked up their ears\u2014touched on the cconomie\ndevelopments of the country during the last twenty\nyears, and went into such minute details that the\nclock on the Riddarholms church struck two before\nhe had arrived at his subject. At the fatal stroke\nof the clock the whole assembly rushed from their\nplaces as if a fire had broken out. When I asked a\ncolleague what it all meant, the old notary, who had\nheard my question, replied : \u2018The primary duty of a\nGovernment employ\u00e9 is punctuality, sir!\u2019 At two\nminutes past two not a soul was left in one of the rooms.\n\n\u201c** We shall have a hot day to-morrow,\u2019 whispered\na colleague, as we went downstairs. \u2018What in the\nname of fortune is going to happen?\u2019 I asked\nuneasily. \u2018Lead pencils,\u2019 he replied. There were\nhot days in store for us. Sealing-wax, envelopes,\npaper-knives, blotting-paper, string. Still, it might\nall be allowed to pass, for every one was occupied.\nBut a day came when there was nothing to do. I\ntook my courage in my hands and asked for work.\nI was given seven reams of paper for making fair\ncopies at home, a feat by which \u2018I should deserve\nwell of my country.\u201d I did my work in a very short\ntime, but instead of receiving appreciation and cn-\ncouragement, I was treated with suspicion;  in-\ndustrious people were not in favour. Sinee then I\u2019ve\nhad no work.\n\n\u201cTl spare you the tedious recital of a year\u2019s\nhumiliations, the countless taunts, the endless bitter-\nness. Everything which appeared small and ridic-\nulous to me was treated with grave solemnity, and\neverything which I considered great and praiseworthy\nwas scoffed at. \u2018The people were called \u2018the mob,\u2019\nand their only use was to be shot at by the army if\noccasion should arise. The new form of government\nwas openly reviled and the peasants were called\ntraitors.*\n\n* Since the great reorganization of the public offices, this description\nia no longer true to life,\n", "\u00abThad to listen to this sort of thing for seven months ;\nthey began to suspect me because 1 didn\u2019t join in\ntheir laughter, and challenged me. Next time the\n\u2018opposition dogs\u2019 were attacked, I exploded and\nmade a speech, the result of which was that they\nknew where I stood, and that I was henceforth im-\npossible. And now I shall do what so many other\nshipwrecks have done: I shall throw myself into the\narms of literature.\u201d\n\nStruve, who seemed dissatisfied with the truncated\nending, put the pencil back, sipped his toddy and\nlooked Scent aasaded, Nevertheless, he thought he\nought to say something.\n\n\u201c\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d he remarked at last, \u201c you\nhaven\u2019t yet learned the art of living; you will find\nout how difficult it is to earn bread and butter, and\nhow it gradually becomes the main interest. One\nworks to eat and eats to be able to work. Believe\nme, who have wife and child, that I know what I\u2019m\ntalking about. You must cut your coat according\nto your cloth, you see\u2014according to your cloth.\nAnd you\u2019ve no idea what the position of a writer is.\nHe stands outside society.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cTfis punishment for aspiring to stand above it.\nMoreover, I detest society, for it is not founded on a\nvoluntary basis. It\u2019s a web of lies\u2014I renounce it\nwith pleasure.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s beginning to grow chilly,\u201d said Struve.\n\n\u201cYes ; shall we go?\u201d\n\n** Perhaps we'd better.\u201d\n\nThe flame of conversation had flickered out.\n\nMeanwhile the sun had set; the half moon had\nrisen and hung over the fields to the north of the\ntown. Star after star struggled with the daylight\nwhich still lingered in the sky; the gas-lamps were\nbeing lighted in the town ; the noise and uproar was\nbeginning to die away.\n\nFalk and Struve walked together in the direction\nof the north, talking of commerce, navigation, the\ncrafts, everything in fact which did not interest\n", "them; finally, to each other\u2019s relief, they\nparted.\n\nFalk strolled down River Street towards the dock-\nyard, his brain pregnant with new thoughts. He\nfelt like a bird which had flown against a window-pane\nand now lay bruised on the ground at the very\nmoment when it had spread its wings to fly towards\nfreedom. He sat down on a scat, listening to the\nplashing of the waves; a light breeze had sprung\nup and rustled through the flowering maple trees,\nand the faint light of the half moon shone on the\nblack water; twenty, thirty boats lay moored on\nthe quay; they tore at their chains for a moment,\nraised their heads, one after the other, and dived\ndown again, underneath the water; wind and wave\nseemed to drive them onward; they made little\nruns towards the bridge like a pack of hounds, but\nthe chain held them in leash and left them kicking\nand stamping, as if they were eager to break loose.\n\nHe remained in his seat till midnight; the wind\nfell asleep, the waves went to rest, the fettered boats\nceased tugging at their chains; the maples stopped\nrustling, and the dew was beginning to fall.\n\nThen he rose and strolled home, dreaming, to his\nlonely attic in the north-eastern part of the town.\n\nThat is what young Falk did; but old Struve,\nwho on the same day had become a member of the\nstaff of the Grey Bonnet, because the Red Cap\nhad sacked him, went home and wrote an article\nfor the notorious People\u2019s Flag, on the Board of\nPayment of Employ\u00e9s\u2019 Salaries, four columns at five\ncrowns a column.\n", "CHAPTER II\nBETWEEN BROTHERS\n\nTue flax merchant, Charles Nicholas Falk\u2014son of\nthe late flax merchant, one of the fifty elders of the\nburgesses, captain of the infantry of militia, vestry-\nman and member of the Board of Administration of\nthe Stockholm Fire Insurance, Charles John Falk,\nand brother of the former assessor and present writer,\nArvid Falk\u2014had a business or, as his enemies pre-\nferred to call it, a shop in Long Street East, nearly\nopposite Pig Street, so that the young man who sat\nbehind the counter, surreptitiously reading a novel,\ncould see a piece of a steamer, the paddle-box\nperhaps, or the jib-boom, and the crown of a tree on\nSkeppsholm, with a patch of sky above it, whenever\nhe raised his eyes from his book.\n\nThe shop assistant, who answered to the not\nunusual name of Andersson, and he had learnt to\nanswer to it, had just\u2014it was early in the morning\u2014\nopened the shop, hung up outside the door a flax\ntress, a fish and an eel basket, a bundle of fishing-\nrods, and a crawl of unstripped quills; this done,\nhe had swept the shop, strewn the floor with sawdust,\nand sat down behind the counter. He had converted\nan empty candle-box into a kind of mouse-trap,\nwhich he set with a hooked stick; immediately on\nthe appearance of his principal, or any of the latter\u2019s\nfends the novel on which Andersson was intent\ndropped into the box. He did not seem afraid of\ncustomers ; for one thing it was early in the morning\nand for another he was not used to very many\ncustomers.\n\nIx\n", "The business had been established in the days of\nthe late King Frederick\u2014Charles Nicholas alk had\ninherited this statement from his father, to whom it\nhad descended from his grandfather ; it had flourished\nand earned a good deal of money unti] a few years\nago; but the disastrous chamber-system killed trade,\nruined all prospects, impeded all enterprise, and\nthreatened all citizens with bankruptey. So, at\nleast, Falk said; others were inclined to believe\nthat the business was mismanaged; to say nothing\nof the fact that a dangerous competitor had estab-\nlished himself close to the lock. Falk never talked\nof the decline of the business if he could help it,\nand he was shrewd enough carefully to choose\noccasion and audience whenever he touched upon\nthat string. If an old business connexion expressed\nsurprise, in a friendly way, at the reduced trade, he\ntold him that his principal business was a wholesale\ntrade in the provinces, and that he was looking upon\nthe shop merely in the light of a sign-board ; nobody\ndoubted this, for he had, behind the shop, a small\ncounting-house where he generally could be found\nwhen he was not in town or at the Exchange. But\nit was quite another tale if any of his acquaintances,\nsuch as the notary or the schoolmaster, for instance,\nexpressed the same friendly uneasiness. Then he blamed\nthe bad times, the result of the new chamber-system ;\nthis alone was to blame for the stagnation of trade.\n\nAndersson was disturbed in his reading by two or\nthree boys who were standing in the doorway, asking\nthe price of the fishing-rods. Looking out into the\nstrect he caught sight of our Mr. Arvid Falk. Falk\nhad lent him the book, so that it could safely be\nleft on the counter; and as his former play{fcllow\nentered the shop, he greeted him familiarly, with a\nknowing look.\n\n\u201cIs he upstairs?\u201d asked Falk, not without a\ncertain uneasiness.\n\n** Tfe\u2019s at breakfast,\u201d replicd Andersson, pointing\nto the ceiling.\n", "A chair was pushed back on the floor above their\nheads.\n\n\u201c He\u2019s got up from the table now, Mr. Arvid.\u201d\n\nBoth young men seemed familiar with the noise\nand its purport. Heavy, creaking footsteps crossed\nthe floor, apparently in all directions, and a subdued\nmurmur penetrated through the ceiling to the\nlisteners below.\n\n** Was he at home last night ? \u201d asked Falk.\n\n** No, he was out.\u201d\n\n** With friends or acquaintances ? \u201d\u201d\n\n\u201c* Acquaintances.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018 Did he come home late ? \u201d\n\n* Very late.\u201d\n\n*Do you think he'll be coming down soon,\nAndersson ? I don\u2019t want to go upstairs on account\nof my sister-in-law.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe'll be here directly; I can tell by his foot-\nsteps.\u201d\n\nA door slammed upstairs; they looked at each\nother significantly. Arvid made a movement towards\nthe door, but pulled himself together.\n\nA few moments later they heard sounds in the\ncounting-house. A violent cough shook the little\nroom and then came the well-known footsteps,\nsaying : stamp\u2014stamp, stamp\u2014stamp !\n\nArvid went behind the counter and knocked at\nthe door of the counting-house.\n\n** Come in!\u201d\n\nHe stood before his brother, a man of forty who\nlooked his age. He was fifteen years older than\nArvid, and for that and other reasons he had accus-\ntomed himself to look upon his younger brother as\na boy towards whom he acted as a father. He had\nfair hair, a fair moustache, fair eyebrows, and\neye-lashes. He was rather stout, and _ that\nwas the reason why his boots always creaked ;\nwid groaned under the weight of his thick-set\n\ngure.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s only you?\u201d he said with good-natured\n\nB\n", "contempt. This attitude of mind was typical of the\nman; he was never angry with those who for some\nreason or other could be considered his inferiors ; he\ndespised them. But his face expressed disappoint-\nment ; he had expected a more satisfactory subject\nfor an outburst ; his brother was shy and modest,\nons never offered resistance if he could possibly\nhelp it.\n\n\u201cT hope I\u2019m not inconveniencing you, brother\nCharles ?\u201d\u2019 asked Arvid, standing on the threshold.\nThis humble question disposed the brother to show\nbenevolence. He helped himself to a cigar from\nhis big, embroidered leather cigar-case, offering his\nbrother a smoke from a box which stood near the\nfireplace ; that boxful\u2014visitors\u2019 cigars, as he frankly\nealled them, and he was of a candid disposition\u2014\nhad been through a shipwreck, which made them\ninteresting, but did not improve them, and a sale by\nauction on the strand, which had made them very\ncheap.\n\n\u201cWell, what is it you want?\u201d asked Charles\nNicholas, lighting his cigar, and absent-mindedly\nputting the match into his pocket\u2014he could only\nconcentrate his thoughts on one spot inside a not\nvery large circumference; his tailor could have\nexpressed the size of it in inches after measuring him\nround the stomach.\n\n**T want to talk business with you,\u201d answered\nArvid, fingering his unlighted cigar.\n\n** Sit down ! \u201d commanded the brother.\n\nIt was customary with him to ask people to sit\ndown whenever he intended to take them to task ;\nhe had them under him, then, and it was more easy\nto crush them\u2014if necessary.\n\n* Business ? Are we doing business together ? \u201d\nhe began. \u2018\u2018I don\u2019t know anything about it. Are\nyou doing business ?. Are you?\u201d\n\n*T only meant to say that I should like to know\nwhether there\u2019s anything more coming to me ? \u201d\n\n* What, may I ask? Do you mean money ?\u201d\n", "said Charles Nicholas, jestingly, allowing his brother\nto enjoy the scent of his good cigar. As the reply,\nwhich he did not want, was not forthcoming, he\nwent on:\n\n\u201cComing to you? Haven\u2019t you received every-\nthing due to you? MHaven\u2019t you yourself receipted\nthe account for the Court of Wards ? Haven\u2019t I kept\nand clothed you since\u2014to be strictly correct, haven\u2019t\nI made you a loan, according to your own wish, to be\npaid back when you are able to do so? I\u2019ve put it\nall down, in readiness for the day when you will be\nearning your livelihood, a thing which you\u2019ve not\ndone yet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to do it now, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\nI wanted to know whether there\u2019s still anything\nowing to me, or whether I am in debt.\u201d\n\nThe brother cast a penetrating look at his victim,\nwondering whether he had any mental reservations.\nHis creaking boots began stamping the floor on a\ndiagonal line between spittoon and umbrella-stand ;\nthe trinkets on his watch-chain tinkled, a warning to\npeople not to cross his way; the smoke of his cigar\nrose and lay in long, ominous clouds, portentous of\na thunderstorm, between tiled stove and door. He\n\u201csi up and down the room furiously, his head\n\nwed, his shoulders rounded, as if he were rehearsing\na part. When he thought he knew it, he stopped\nshort before his brother, gazed into his eyes with a\nlong, glinting, deceitful look, intended to express\nboth confidence and sorrow, and said, in a voice\nmeant to sound as if it came from the family grave\nin the churchyard of St. Clara\u2019s :\n\n** You're not straight, Arvid; you\u2019re not straight.\u201d\n\nWho, with the exception of Andersson, who was\nstanding behind the door, listening, would not have\nbeen touched by those words, spoken by a brother to a\nbrother, fraught with the deepest brotherly sorrow ?\nEven Arvid, accustomed from his childhood to\nbelieve all men perfect and himself alone unworthy,\nwondered for a moment whether he was straight or\n", "not ? And as his cdueation, by efficacious means,\nhad provided him with a highly sensitive conscience,\nhe found that he really had not been quite straight,\nor at least quite frank, when he asked his brother\nthe not-altogether candid question as to whether he\nwasn\u2019t a scoundrel.\n\n\u201c\u201cTP\u2019ve come to the conclusion,\u201d he said, \u201c that\nyou cheated me out of a part of my inheritance ;\nI\u2019ve calculated that you charged too much for your\ninferior board and your cast-off clothes; I know\nthat I didn\u2019t spend all my fortune during my terrible\ncollege days, and I believe that you owe me a fairly\nbig sum; I want it now, and I request you to hand\nit over to me.\u201d\n\nA smile illuminated the brother\u2019s fair face, and\nwith an expression so calm and a gesture so steady,\nthat he might have been rehearsing them for years,\nso as to be in readiness when his cue was given to\nhim, he put his hand in his trousers pocket, rattled\nhis faneh of keys before taking it out, threw it up\nand dexterously caught it again, and walked solemnly\nto his safe. He opened it more quickly than he\nintended and, perhaps, than the sacredness of the\nspot justified, took out a paper lying ready to his\nhand and evidently also waiting for its cue, and\nhanded it to his brother.\n\n\u201cDid you write this? Answer me! Did you\nwrite it ?\u201d\n\nee Yes ! 3\u00b0\n\nArvid rose and turned towards the door.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t go! Sit down! Sit down!\u201d\n\nIf a dog had been present it would have sat down\nat once.\n\n\u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s written here? Read it! \u2018I, Arvid\nFalk, acknowledge and_ testify\u2014that\u2014I\u2014have re-\neeived from my brother, Charles Nicholas Falk\u2014\nwho was appointed my guardian\u2014my inheritance\nin full\u2014amounting to\u2014\u2019 and so on.\u201d He was\nashamed to mention the sum. |\n\n\u201cYou have acknowledged\u00a5and testified a fact\n", "which you did not believe. Is that straight ? No,\nanswer my question! Is that straight? No!\nTherefore you have borne false witness. Ergo\u2014\nyou're a blackguard! Yes, that\u2019s what you are!\nAm I right ?\u201d\n\nThe part was too excellent and the triumph too\ngreat to be enjoyed without an audience. The\ninnocently accused must have witnesses. He opened\nthe door leading into the shop.\n\n** Andersson ! \u201d\u2019 he shouted, \u201c\u2018 answer this question !\nListen to me! If I bear false witness, am I a black-\nguard or not ?\u201d\n\n** Of course, you are a blackguard, sir ! \u201d\u201d Andersson\nanswered unhesitatingly and with warmth.\n\n\u201cDo you hear? He says I\u2019m a blackguard\u2014if\nI put my signature to a false receipt. What did I\nsay? You\u2019re not straight, Arvid, you are not\nstraight. Good-natured people often are black-\nguards; you have always been good-natured and\nyielding, but I\u2019ve always been aware that in your\nsecret heart you harboured very different thoughts ;\n. a blackguard! Your father always said so;\n\nsay \u2018 said,\u2019 for he always said what he thought, and\nhe was a straight man, Arvid, and that\u2014you\u2014are\u2014\nnot! And you may be sure that if he were still\nalive he would say with grief and pain: \u2018 You\u2019re not\nstraight, Arvid, you\u2014are\u2014not\u2014straight !\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe did a few more diagonal lines and it sounded\nas if he were applauding the scene with his feet ; he\nrattled his bunch of keys as if he were giving the\nsignal for the curtain to rise. His closing remarks\nhad been so rounded off that the smallest addition\n\nwould have spoilt the whole. In spite of the heavy\ncharge which he had actually expected for years\u2014\nfor he had always believed his brother to be acting\na part\u2014he was very glad that it was over, happily\nover, well and cleverly over, so that he felt almost\ngay and even a little grateful. Moreover he had had\na splendid chance of venting the wrath which had been\nkindled upstairs, in his family, on some one; to vent\n", "it on Andersson had lost its charm; and he knew\n\nbetter than to vent it on his wife.\n\nArvid was silent; the education he had received\nhad so intimidated him that he always believed\nhimself to be in the wrong; since his childhood the\ngreat words \u201cupright, honest, sincere, true,\u201d had\ndaily and hourly been drummed into his ears, so\nthat they stood before him like a judge, continuously\nsaying: \u201cGuilty... .\u201d For a moment he thought\nthat he must have been mistaken in his calculations,\nthat his brother must be innocent and he himself a\nscoundrel ; but immediately after he realized that\nhis brother was a cheat, deceiving him by a simple\nlawyer\u2019s trick. He felt prompted to run away, fear-\nful of being drawn into a quarrel, to run away without\nmaking his request number two, and confessing that\nhe was on the point of changing his profession.\n\nThere was a long pause. Charles Nicholas had\nplenty of time to recapitulate his triumph in his\nmemory. \u2018That little word \u201c blackguard \u201d had done\nhis tongue good. It had been as pleasant as if he\nhad said *\u2018 Get out!\u201d And the opening of the door,\nAndersson\u2019s reply, and the production of the paper,\neverything had passed off splendidly ; he had not\nforgotten the bunch of keys on his night-table; he\nhad turned the key in the lock without any difficulty ;\nhis proof was binding as a rope, the conclusion he\nhad drawn had been the baited hook by which the\nfish had been caught.\n\nHe had regained his good temper ; he had forgiven,\nnay, he had forgotten, and as he slammed the door\nof the safe, he shut away the disagreeable story for\never.\n\nBut he did not want to part from his brother in\nthis mood; he wanted to talk to him on other\nsubjects ; throw a few shovelfuls of gossip on the\nunpleasant affair, see him under commonplace cir-\ncumstances, sitting at his table, for instanee\u2014and\nwhy not eating and drinking ? People always looked\nhappy and content when they were cating and\n", "drinking ; he wanted so see him happy and content.\nHe wanted to sec his face calm, listen to his voice\nspeaking without a tremor, and he resolved to ask\nhim to luncheon. But he felt puzzled how to lead\nup to it, find a suitable bridge across the gulf. He\nsearched his brain, but found nothing. He searched\nhis pockets and found\u2014the match.\n\n\u201cHang it all, you\u2019ve never lit your cigar, old\nboy!\u201d he exclaimed with genuine, not feigned,\nwarmth.\n\nBut the old boy had crushed his cigar during the\nconversation, so that it would not draw.\n\n**Look here! Take another!\u2019 and he pulled out\nhis big leather case.\n\n\u201cHere! Take one of these! They are good\nones !\u201d\n\nArvid, who, unfortunately, could not bear to hurt\nanybody\u2019s feelings, accepted it gratefully, like a\nhand offered in reconciliation.\n\n\u201c\u201cNow, old boy,\u201d continued Charles_ Nicholas,\ntalking lightly and pleasantly, an accomplishment at\nwhich he was an expert. \u201c Let\u2019s go to the nearest\nrestaurant and have lunch. Come along!\u201d\n\nArvid, unused to friendliness, was so touched by\nthes\u00e9 advances that he hastily pressed his brother\u2019s\nhand and hurried away through the shop without\ntaking any notice of Andersson, and out into the\nstreet.\n\nThe brother felt embarrassed; he could not under-\nstand it. To run away when he had been asked to\nlunch! To run away when he was not in the least\nangry with him! Torunaway! No dog would have\nrun away if a piece of meat had been thrown to him!\n\n\u201c\u201cHe\u2019s a queer chap!\u201d he muttered, stamping the\nfloor. Then he went to his desk, screwed up the seat\nof his chair as high as it would go and climbed up.\nFrom this raised position he was in the habit of\ncontemplating men and circumstances as from a\nhigher point of view, and he found them small ; yet not\nso smal] that he could not use them for his purposes.\n", "CHAPTER III\nTHE ARTISTS\u2019 COLONY\n\nIr was between eight and nine o\u2019clock on the same\nbeautiful May morning. Arvid Falk, after the scene\nwith his brother, was strolling through the streets,\ndissatisfied with himself, his brother, and the whole\nworld. He would have preferred to see the sky\novercast, to be in bad company. He did not believe\nthat he was a blackguard, but he was disappointed\nwith the part he had played; he was accustomed to\nbe severe on himself, and it had always been drummed\ninto him that his brother was a kind of stepfather\nto whom he owed great respect, not to say reverence.\nBut he was worried and depressed by other thoughts\nas well. He had neither money nor prospect of work.\nThe last contingency was, perhaps, the worse of the\ntwo, for to him, with his exuberant imagination,\nidleness was a dangerous enemy.\n\nBrooding over these disagreeable facts, he had\nreached Little Garden Strect ; he sauntered along,\non the left pavement, passed the Dramatic Theatre,\nand soon reached High Street North. He walked\non aimlessly ; the pavement became uneven ; wooden\ncottages took the place of the stone houses; badly\ndressed men and women were throwing suspicious\nglances at the well-dressed stranger who was visiting\ntheir quarter at such an early hour; famished dogs\ngrowled threateningly at him. He hastened past\ngroups of gunners, labourers, brewers\u2019 men, laun-\ndresses, and apprentices, and finally came to Great\nHop-Garden Street. Ue entered the Hop-Garden.\nThe cows belonging to the Inspector-General of\n\n24\n", "Ordnance were grazing in the fields; the old, bare\napple trees were making the first efforts to put forth\nbuds ; but the lime trees were already in leaf and\nsquirrels were playing up and down the branches.\nHe passed the merry-go-round and came to the\navenue leading to the theatre; here he met some\ntruant schoolboys engaged in a game of buttons ;\na little further a painter\u2019s apprentice was lying in\nthe grass on his back staring at the clouds through\nthe dome of foliage; he was whistling carelessly,\nindifferent to the fact that master and men were\nwaiting for him, while flies and other insects drowned\nthemselves in his paint-pots.\n\nFalk had walked to the top of the hill and had come\nto the duck-pond; he stood still for a while, studying\nthe metamorphoses of the frogs; watching the\nleeches ; cling a water-spider. Then he began\nto throw stones. The exercise brought his blood into\ncirculation ; he felt rejuvenated, a schoolboy playing\ntruant, free, defiantly free! It was freedom bought\nby great self-sacrifice. The thought of being able\nto commune with nature freely and at will, made him\nglad ; he understood nature better than men who had\nonly ill-treated and slandered him; his unrest\ndisappeared ; he rose and continued his way further\ninto the country.\n\nWalking through the Cross, he came into Hop-\nGarden Street North. Some of the boards were\nmissing in the fence facing him, and there was a\nvery plainly marked footpath on the other side. He\ncrept through the hole, disturbing an old woman who\nwas gathering nettles, crossed the large tobacco field\nwhere a colony of villas has now sprung up, and found\nhimself at the gate of \u2018 Lill-Jans.\u201d\n\nThere was no doubt of its being spring in the little\nsettlement, consisting of three cottages snugly nestling\namong elders and apple trees, and sheltered from the\nnorth wind by the pinewood on the other side of the\nHigh Road. The visitor was regaled with a perfect\nlittle idyll. A cock, perched on the shafts of a water-\n", "cart, was basking in the sun and catching flies, the bees\nhung in a cloud round the bee-hives, the gardener\nwas kneeling by the hot-beds, sorting radishes ; the\nwarblers and brand-tails were singing in the goose-\nberry bushes, while lightly clad children chased the\nfowls bent on examining the germinative capacity\nof various newly sown seeds. A brilliant blue sky\nspanned the scene and the dark forest framed the\nbackground.\n\nTwo men were sitting close to the hot-beds, in the\nshelter of the fence. One of them, wearing a tall,\nblack hat and a threadbare, black suit, had a long,\nnarrow, pale face, and looked like a clergyman.\nWith his stout but deformed body, drooping eyelids,\nand Mongolian moustache, the other one belonged to\nthe type of civilized peasant. He was very badly\ndressed and might have been many things: a vaga-\nbond, an artisan, or an artist ; he looked seedy, but\nseedy in an original way.\n\nThe lean man, who obviously felt chilly, although\nhe sat right in the sun, was reading to his friend from\na book; the latter looked as though he had tried all\nthe climates of the earth and was able to stand them\nall equally well.\n\nAs Falk entered the garden gate from the high road,\nhe could distinctly hear the reader\u2019s words through\nthe fence, and he thought it no breach of confidence\nto stand still for a while and listen.\n\nThe lean man was reading in a dry, monotonous\nvoice, a voice without resonance, and his stout friend\nevery now and then acknowledged his appreciation\nby a snort which changed occasionally into a grunt\nand became a splutter whenever the words of wisdom\nto which he was listening surpassed ordinary human\nunderstanding.\n\n\u201c\u201c*'The highest principles are, as already stated,\nthree; one, absolutely unconditioned, and two,\nrelatively unconditioned ones. Pro primo: the\nabsolutely first, purely unconditioned principle,\nwould express the action underlying all consciousness\n", "and without which consciousness cannot exist. This\nprinciple is the identity A-A. It endures and\ncannot be disposed of by thought when all empirical\ndefinitions of consciousness are prescinded. It is\nthe original fact of consciousness and must therefore,\nof necessity, be acknowledged. Moreover, it is not\nconditioned like every other empirical fact, but as\nconsequence and substance of a voluntary act entirely\nunconditioned.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cDo you follow, Olle?\u2019 asked the reader,\ninterrupting himself.\n\n\u201cTt\u2019s amazing! It is not conditioned like every\nother empirical fact. Oh! What aman! Go on!\nGo on!\u201d\n\n\u201c*Tf it is maintained,\u2019\u201d continued the reader,\n*\u201c*\u201cthat this proposition without any further proof be\ntrue ....\u201d\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! I say ! What a rascal ! without any further\nproof be true,\u201d repeated the grateful listener, bent\non: dissipating all suspicion that he had not grasped\nwhat had been read, \u201c without any further reason,\nhow subtle, how subtle of him to say that instead\nof simply saying \u2018 without any reason.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cAm I to continue ? Or do you intend to go on\ninterrupting me ?\u201d\u2019 asked the offended reader.\n\n\u201cIT won\u2019t interrupt again. Goon! Goon!\u201d\n\n*\u201c* Well, now he draws the conclusion (really excel-\nlent): \u2018If one ascribes to oneself the ability to sta\na proposition\u2014\u2014\u2019 \u201d te\n\nOlle snorted.\n\n\u201c\u201c* One does not propose thereby A (capital A),\nbut merely that A - A, if and in so far as A exists\nat all. It is not a question of the essence of an asser-\ntion but only of its form. The proposition A\u2014A is\ntherefore conditioned (hypothetically) as far as its\nessence is concerned, and unconditioned only as far as\nits form goes.\u2019\n\n\u201c* Have you noticed the capital A ?\u201d\n\nFalk had heard enough; this was the terribly\nprofound philosophy of Upsala, which had strayed to\n", "Stockholm to conquer and subduc the coarse instinets\nof the capital. He looked at the fowls to see\nwhether they had not tumbled off their roosts ; at\nthe parsley whether it had not stopped growing\nwhile made to listen to the profoundest wisdom ever\nproclaimed by human voice at Lill-Jans; he was\nsurprised to find that the sky had not fallen after\nwitnessing such a feat of mental strength. At\nthe same time his base human nature clamoured\nfor attention: his throat was parehed, and_ he\ndecided to ask for a glass of water at one of the\ncottages.\n\n\u2018Turning back he strolled towards the hut on the\nright-hand side of the road, coming from town. The\ndoor leading into a large room\u2014once a bakery\u2014\nfrom an entrance-hall the size of a travelling trunk,\nstood open. The room contained a bed-sofa, a broken\nchair, an easel, and two men. One of them, wearing\nonly a shirt and a pair of trousers kept up by a leather\nbelt, was standing before the casel. He looked like\na journeyman, but he was an artist making a sketch for\nan altar-piece. \u2018The other man was a youth with\nclear-cut features and, considering his environment,\nwell-made clothes. He had taken off his coat,\nturned back his shirt and was serving as the artist\u2019s\nmodel. His handsome, noble face showed traces of\na night of dissipation, and every now and then he\ndozed, cach time reprimanded by the master who\nseemed to have taken him under his protection. As\nFalk was entering the room he heard the burden of\none of these reprimands :\n\n\u201cThat you should make such a hog of yourself\nand spend the night drinking with that loafer Sell\u00e9n,\nand now be standing here wasting your time instead\nof being at the Commercial School! The right\nshoulder a little higher, please ; that\u2019s better! Is it\ntrue that you\u2019ve spent all the money for your rent\nand daren\u2019t go home? Have you nothing left ?\nNot one farthing ?\u201d\n\n**1 still have some, but it won\u2019t go far.\u201d The\n", "young man fore a scrap of paper out of his trousers\npocket, and straightening it out, produced two\nnotes for a crown each.\n\n\u201cGive them to me, I'll take care of them for\nyou,\u201d exclaimed the master, seizing them with\nfatherly solicitude.\n\nFalk, who had vainly tried to attract their attention,\nthought it best to depart as quietly as he had come.\nOnce more passing the manure heap and the two\nphilosophers, he turned to theleft. He had not gone\nfar when he caught sight of a young man who had put\nup his easel at the edge of a little bog planted with\nalder trees, close to the wood. He had a graceful,\nslight, almost elegant figure, and a thin, dark face.\nHe seemed to scintillate life as he stood before his\neasel, working at a fine picture. He had taken off\nhis coat and hat and appeared to be in excellent\nhealth and spirits ; alternately talking to himself and\nwhistling or humming snatches of song.\n\nWhen Falk was near enough to have him in profile\nhe turned round.\n\n\u201c\u201cSell\u00e9n ! Good morning, old chap!\u201d\n\n\u201cFalk! Fancy meeting you out here in the wood !\nWhat the deuce does it mean? Oughtn\u2019t you to be\nat your office at this time of day ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! But are you living out here ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; I came here on the first of April with some\npals. Found life in town too expensive\u2014and,\nmoreover, landlords are so particular.\u201d\n\nA sly smile played about one of the corners of his\nmouth and his brown eyes flashed.\n\n\u201cT see,\u201d Falk began again; \u201cthen perhaps you\nknow the two individuals who were sitting by the\nhot-beds just now, reading ? \u201d\n\n\u201cThe philosophers ? Of course, I do! The tall\none is an assistant at the Public Sales Office at a\nsalary of eighty crowns per annum, and the short\none, Olle Montanus, ought to be at home at his\nsculpture\u2014but since he and Ygberg have taken up\nphilosophy, he has left off working and is fast going\n", "down hill. He has discovered that there is something\nsensual in art.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s he living on ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn nothing at all! Occasionally he sits to the\npractical Lundell and then he gets a piece of black\npudding. This lasts him for about a day. In the\nwinter Lundell lets him lie on his floor; \u2018he helps\nto warm the room,\u2019 he says, and wood is very dear ;\nit was very cold here in April.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can he be a model ? He looks such a God-\nhelp-me sort of chap.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cHe poses for one of the thieves in Lundell\u2019s\n\u2018**Deseent from the Cross,\u201d the one whose bones are\nalready broken ; the poor devil\u2019s suffering from hip\ndisease ; he does splendidly when he leans across the\nback of a chair ; sometimes the artist makes him turn\nhis back to him; then he represents the other\nthief.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why doesn\u2019t he work himself ? Has he no\ntalent ?\u201d\n\n** Olle Montanus, my dear fellow, is a genius, but\nhe won\u2019t work. He\u2019s a philosopher and would have\nbecome a great man if he could have gone to college.\nIt\u2019s really extraordinary to listen to him and Ygberg\ntalking philosophy ; it\u2019s true, Ygberg has read more,\nbut in spite of that Montanus, with his subtle brain,\nsucceeds in cornering him every now and again;\nthen Ygberg goes away and reads some more, but he\nnever lends the book to Montanus.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cIT see! And you like Ygberg\u2019s philosophy ?\u201d\nasked Falk.\n\n\u201cOh! It\u2019s subtle, wonderfully subtle! You like\nFichte, don\u2019t you? Isay! What aman!\u201d\n\n\u2018Who were the two individuals in the cottage ? \u201d\nasked Falk, who did not like Fichte.\n\n\u201cOh. You saw them too? One of them was the\npractical Lundell, a painter of figures, or rather,\nsacred subjects; the other one was my friend\nRehnhjelm.\u201d\n\nIe pronounced the last few words with the utmost\n", "indifference, so as to heighten their effect as much as\npossible.\n\n** Rehnhjelm ? \u201d\n\n** Yes; a very nice fellow.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was acting as Lundell\u2019s model.\u201d\n\n**Was he? That\u2019s like Lundell! He knows how\nto make use of people ; he is extraordinarily practical.\nBut come along, let\u2019s worry him; it\u2019s the only fun I\nhave out here. Then, perhaps, you\u2019ll hear Montanus\nspeaking, and that\u2019s really worth while.\u201d\n\nLess for the sake of hearing Montanus speaking\nthan for the sake of obtaining a glass of water, Falk\nfollowed Sell\u00e9n, helping him to carry easel and paint-\nbox.\n\nThe scene in the cottage was slightly changed;\nthe model was now sitting on the broken chair, and\nMontanus and Ygberg on the bed-sofa. Lundell was\nstanding at his easel, smoking; his seedy friends\nwatched him and his old, snoring cherry-wood pipe; the\nvery presence of a pipe and tobacco raised their spirits.\n\nFalk was introduced and immediately Lundell\nmonopolized him, asking him for his opinion of the\npicture he was painting. It was a Rubens, at least as\nfar asthe subject went, though anything but a Rubens\nin colour and drawing. Thereupon Lundell dilated\non the hard times and difficulties of an artist, severely\ncriticized the Academy, and censured the Government\nfor neglecting native art. He was engaged in\nsketching an altar-piece, although he was convinced\nthat it would be refused, for nobody could succeed\nwithout intrigues andconnexions. And hescrutinized\nFalk\u2019s clothes, wondering whether he might be a\nuseful connexion.\n\nFalk\u2019s appearance had produced a different effect\non the two philosophers. They scented a man of\nletters in him, and Rated him because he might rob\nthem of the reputation they enjoyed in the small\ncircle. They exchanged significant glances, imme-\ndiately understood by Sell\u00e9n, who found it impossible\nto resist the temptation of showing off his friends\n", "in their glory, and, if possible, bring about an en-\ncounter. He soon found an apple of discord, aimed,\nthrew, and hit.\n\n\u2018** What do you say to Lundell\u2019s picture, Ygberg ? \u201d\n\nYgberg, not expecting to be called upon to speak\nso soon, had to consider his answer for a few seconds.\nThen he made his reply, raising his voice, while\nOlle rubbed his back to make him hold himself\nstraight.\n\n\u2018** A work of art may, in my opinion, be divided into\ntwo categories: subject and form. With regard\nto the subject in this work of art there is no denying\nthat it is profound and universally human; the\nmotive, properly speaking, is in itself fertile, and\ncontains all the potentialities of artistic work. With\nregard to the form which of itself shall de facto manifest\nthe idea, that is to say the absolute identity, the\nbeing, the ego\u2014I cannot help saying that I find it less\nadequate.\u201d\n\nLundell was obviously flattered. Olle smiled his\nsunniest smile as if he were contemplating the\nheavenly hosts; the model was asleep and Sell\u00e9n\nfound that Ygberg had scored a complete success.\nAll eyes were turned on Falk who was compelled to\ntake up the gauntlet, for no one doubted that Ygberg\u2019s\ncriticism was a challenge.\n\nFalk was both amused and annoyed. He was\nsearching the limbo of memory for philosophical\nair-guns, when he caught sight of Olle Montanus,\nwhose convulsed face betrayed his desire to speak.\nFalk loaded his gun at random with Aristotle and\nfired.\n\n*\u201cWhat do you mean by adequate? I cannot\nrecollect that Aristotle made use of that word in his\nMetaphysics.\u201d\n\nAbsolute silence fell on the room; everybody felt\nthat a fight between the artist\u2019s colony and the\nUniversity of Upsala was imminent. The interval\nwas longer than was desirable, for Ygberg was\nunacquainted with Aristotle and would have died\n", "sooner than have admitted it. As he was not quick\nat repartee, he failed to discover the breach which\nFalk had left open; but Olle did, caught Aristotle\nwith both hands and flung him back at his opponent.\n\n\u201c Although I\u2019m not a learned man, I venture to\nquestion\u2019 whether you, Mr. Falk, have upset your\nopponent\u2019s argument? In my opinion adequate\nmay be used and accepted as a definition in a logical\nconclusion, in spite of Aristotle not having mentioned\nthe word in his Metaphysics. Am I right, gentle-\nmen? I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a learned man and\nMr. Falk has made a study of these things.\u201d\n\nHe had spoken with half-closed eyelids; now he\nclosed them entirely and looked impudently shy.\n\nThere was a general murmur of \u201c Olle is right.\u201d\n\nFalk realized that this was a matter to be handled\nwithout mittens, if the honour of Upsala was to be\nsafeguarded ; he made a pass with the philosophical\npack of cards and threw up an ace.\n\n\u2018* Mr. Montanus has denied the antecedent or said\nsimply : nego majorem! Very well! I, on my part,\ndeclare that he has been guilty of a posterius prius ;\nwhen he found himself on the horns of a dilemma he\nwent astray and made a syllogism after ferioque\ninstead of barbara. He has forgotten the golden rule :\nCesare camestres festino baroco secundo; and there-\nfore his conclusion became weakened. Am I right\ngentlemen ?\u201d\n\n* Quite right, absolutely right,\u2019\u2019 replied everybody,\nexcept the two philosophers who had never held a\nbook of logic in their hands.\n\nYgberg looked as if he had bitten on a nail, and\nOlle grinned as if a handful of snuff had been thrown\ninto his eyes; but his native shrewdness had dis-\ncovered the tactical method of his opponent. He\nresolved not to stick to the point, but to talk of\nsomething else. He brought out everything he had\nlearned and everything he had heard, beginning with\nthe Criticism of Fichte\u2019s Philosophy to which Falk\nhad been listening a little while ago from behind\n\nc\n", "the fence. The discussion went on until the morning\nwas nearly spent.\n\nIn the meantime Lundell went on painting, his foul\npipe snoring loudly. The model had fallen asleep\non the broken chair, his head sinking deeper and\ndeeper until, about noon, it hung between his knees ;\na mathematician could have calculated the time when\nit would reach the centre of the carth.\n\nSell\u00e9n was sitting at the open window enjoying\nhimself; but poor Falk, who had been under the\nimpression that this terrible philosophy was a thing\nof the past, was compelled to continue throwing\nfistfuls of philosophic snuff into the eyes of his\nantagonists. The torture would never have come\nto an end if the model\u2019s centre of gravity had not\ngradually shifted to one of the most delicate parts\nof the chair ; it gave way and the Baron fell on the\nfloor. Lundell seized the opportunity to inveigh\nagainst the vice of drunkenness and its miserable\nconsequences for the victim as well as for others ;\nby others he meant, of course, himself.\n\nFalk, anxious to come to the assistance of the\nembarrassed youth, cagerly asked a question bound\nto be of general interest.\n\n\u201c\u201c Where are the gentlemen going to dine ? \u201d\n\nThe room grew silent, so silent that the buzzing of\nthe flies was plainly audible ; Falk was quite uncon-\nseious of the fact that he had stepped on five corns\nat one and the same moment. It was Lundell who\nbroke the silence. He and Rehnhjelm were going to\ndine at the \u201c Sauce-Pan,\u201d their usual restaurant,\nfor they had credit there ; Scll\u00e9n objected to the place\nbecause he did not like the cooking, and had not yet\ndecided on another establishment; he looked at\nthe model with an anxious, inquiring glanee. Ygberg\nand Montanus were too \u201c busy\u201d and \u201c\u2018 not going to\ncut up their working-day \u201d\u2019 by \u201c dressing and going\nup to town.\u201d \u2018They were going to get something\nout here, but they did not say what.\n\nA general dressing began, principally consisting of\n", "a wash at the old garden-pump. Sell\u00e9n, who was a\ndandy, had hidden a parcel wrapped in a newspaper\nunderneath the bed-sofa, from which he produced\ncollar, cuffs and shirt-front, made of paper. He\nknelt for a long time before the pump, gazing into\nthe trough, while he put on a brownish-green tie, a\npresent from a lady, and arranged his hair in a par-\nticular style.\n\nWhen he had rubbed his shoes with a bur leaf,\nbrushed his hat with his coat sleeve, put a grape-\nhyacinth in his button-hole and seized his cinnamon\ncane, he was ready to go. To his question whether\nRehnhjelm would be ready soon, Lundell replied\nthat he would be hours yet, as he required his assist-\nance in drawing; Lundell always devoted the time\nfrom twelve to two todrawing. Rehnhjelm submitted\nand obeyed, although he found it hard to part with\nSell\u00e9n, of whom he was fond, and stay with Lundell\nwhom he disliked. \u2018i i\n\n\u201cWe shall meet to-night at the Red Room,\u201d said\nSell\u00e9n, comforting him, and all agreed, even the\nphilosophers and the moral Lundell.\n\nOn their way to town Sell\u00e9n initiated his friend Falk\ninto some of the secrefS of the colonists. As for\nhimself, he had broken with the Academy, because\nhis views on art differed from theirs; he knew that\nhe had talent and would eventually be successful,\nalthough success might be long in coming. It was,\nof course, frightfully difficult to make a name without\nthe Royal Medal. There were also natural obstacles\nin his way. He was a native of the barren coast of\nHalland and loved grandeur and simplicity ; but\ncritics and public demanded detail and _trifles ;\ntherefore his pictures did not sell; he could have\npainted what everybody else painted, but he scorned\nto do so.\n\nLundell, on the other hand, was a practical man\u2014\nSell\u00e9n always pronounced the word practical with a\ncertain contempt\u2014he painted to please the public.\nHe never suffered from indisposition ; it was true\n", "he had left the Academy, but for secret, practical\nreasons ; moreover, in spite of his assertion, he had\nnot broken with it entirely. He made a good income\nout of his illustrations for magazines and, although\nhe had little talent, he was bound to make his fortune\nsome day, not only because of the number of his con-\nnexions, but also because of his intrigues. It was\nMontanus who had put him up to those; he was\nthe originator of more than one plan which Lundell had\nsuccessfully carried out. Montanus was a genius,\nalthough he was terribly unpractical.\n\nRehnhjelm was a native of Norrland. His father\nhad been a wealthy man; he had owned a large\nestate which was now the property of his former\ninspector. The old aristocrat was comparatively\npoor; he hoped that his son would learn a lesson\nfrom the past, take an inspector\u2019s post and eventually\nrestore the family to its former position by the\nacquisition of a new estate. Buoyed up with this\nhope, he had sent him to the Commercial School to\nstudy agricultural book-keeping, an accomplishment\nwhich the youth detested. He was a good fellow\nbut a little weak, and allowing himself to be in-\nfluenced by Lundell, who did not scorn to take the\nfee for his preaching and patronage in natura.\n\nIn the meantime Lundell and the Baron had started\nwork; the Baron was drawing, while the master\nlay on the sofa, supervising the work, in other words,\nsmoking.\n\n\u201cTf you'll put your back into your work, you\nshall come to dinner with me at the \u2018 Brass-Button,\u2019 \u201d\u2019\npromised Lundell, feeling rich with the two crowns\nwhich he had saved from destruction.\n\nYgberg and Montanus had sauntered up the\nwooded eminence, intending to sleep away the dinner\nhour ; Olle beamed after his victories, but Ygberg was\ndepressed ; his pupil had surpassed him. Moreover,\nhis feet were cold and he was unusually hungry, for\nthe eager discussion of dinner had awakened in him\nslumbering feelings successfully suppressed for the\n", "last twelve months. They threw themselves under\na pine tree; Ygberg hid the precious, carefully\nwrapped up book, which he always refused to lend\nto lie, under his head, and stretched himself full-\npe on the ground; he looked deadly er cold\nand calm like a corpse which has abandoned all hope\nof resurrection. He watched some little birds above\nhis head picking at the pine seed and letting the\nhusks fall down on him; he watched a cow, the\npicture of robust health, grazing among the alders ;\nhe saw the smoke rising from the gardener\u2019s kitchen\nchimney.\n\n\u201cAre you hungry, Olle?\u201d he asked in a feeble\nvoice.\n\n\u201c\u201cNo!\u201d replied Olle, casting covetous looks at the\nwonderful book.\n\n\u201cOh! to be a cow!\u201d sighed Ygberg, crossing his\nhands on his chest and giving himself up to all-\nmerciful sleep.\n\nWhen his low breathing had become regular, the\nwaking friend gently pulled the book from its hiding-\nplace, without disturbing the sleeper; then he\nturned over and lying on his stomach he began to\ndevour the precious contents, forgetting all about\nthe \u201c ace Pon \u201d and the \u2018\u2018 Brass-Button.\u201d\n", "CHAPTER IV\nMASTER AND DOGS\nTwo or three days had passed. Mrs. Charles\nNicholas Falk, a lady of twenty-two years of age,\nhad just finished her breakfast in bed, the colossal\nmahogany bed in the large bedroom. It was only\nten o\u2019clock. Her husband had been away since\nseven, taking up flax on the shore. But the young\nwife had not stayed in bed\u2014a thing she knew too\nbe contrary to the rules of the house\u2014because she\ncounted on his absence. She had only been married\nfor two years, but during that period she had found\nabundant time to introduce sweeping reforms in\nthe old, conservative, middle-class household, where\neverything was old, even the servants. He had\ninvested her with the necessary power on the day\non which he had confessed his love to her, and she\nhad graciously consented to become his wife, that\nis to say, permitted him to deliver her from the\nhated bondage of her parental roof, where she had\nbeen compelled to get up every morning at six\no\u2019clock and work all day long. She had made good\nuse of the period of her engagement, for it was then\nthat she had collected a number of guarantees,\npromising her a free and independent life, unmolested\nby any interference on the part of her husband.\nOf course these guarantees consisted merely of verbal\nassurances made by a love-sick man, but she, who\nhad never allowed her emotion to get the better\nof her, had carefully noted them down on the tablets\nof her memory. After two years of matrimony,\nunredeemed by the promise of a child, the husband\nshowed a decided inclination to set aside all these\n38\n", "guarantees, and question her right to sleep as long\nas she liked, for instance, to have breakfast in bed,\netcetera, etcetera ; he had even been so indelicate as to\nremind her that he had pulled her out of the mire ;\nhad delivered her from a hell, thereby sacrificing him-\nself. The marriage had been a misalliance, her father\nbeing one of the crew of the flagship.\n\nAs she lay there she was concocting replies to\nthese and similar reproaches; and as her common\nsense during the long period of their mutal acquaint-\nance had never been clouded by any intoxication\nof the senses, she had it well in hand and knew how\nto use it. The sounds of her husband\u2019s return filled her\nwith unalloyed pleasure. Presently the dining-room\ndoor was slammed ; a tremendous bellowing became\naudible ; she pushed her head underneath the bed-\nclothes to smother her laughter. Heavy footsteps\ncrossed the adjacent room and the angry husband\nappeared on the threshold, hat on head. His wife, who\nwas turning her back to him, called out in her most\ndulcet tones :\n\n\u201cTs that you, little lubber ? Come in, come in! \u201d\n\nThe little lubber\u2014this was a pet name, and husband\nand wife frequently used others, even more original\nones\u2014showed no inclination to accept her invitation,\nbut remained standing in the doorway and shouted :\n\n** Why isn\u2019t the table laid for lunch ? \u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201c Ask the girls; it isn\u2019t my business to lay the\ntable! But it\u2019s customary to take off one\u2019s hat on\ncoming into a room, sir!\u201d\n\n\u00ab\u2018What have you done with my cap ?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201c Burnt it! It was so greasy, you ought to have\nbeen ashamed to wear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou burnt it? We'll talk about that later on !\nWhy are you lying in bed until all hours of the\nmorning, instead of supervising the girls ? \u201d\n\n** Because I like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think I married a wife to have her\nrefusing to look after her house? What ? \u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cYoudid! But why do you think I married you ?\n", "I\u2019ve told you a thousand times\u2014so that I shouldn\u2019t\nhave to work\u2014and you promised me I shouldn\u2019t.\nDidn\u2019t you? Can you swear, on your word of\nhonour, that you did not promise ? That\u2019s the kind\nof man you are! You are just like all the rest ! \u201d\n\n\u201cIt was long ago!\u201d\n\n\u201cLong ago? When was long ago? Is a promise\nnot binding for all times? Or must it be made in\nany particular season ?\u201d\n\nThe husband knew this unanswerable logic only ,\ntoo well, and his wife\u2019s good temper had the same\neffect as her tears\u2014he gave in.\u201d\n\n*\u2018 I\u2019m going to have visitors to-night,\u2019\u2019 he stated.\n\n*\u201cOh, indeed! Gentlemen ?\u201d\u2019\n\n** Of course! I detest women.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose you\u2019ve ordered what you want ? \u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I want you to do that.\u201d\n\n\u201c1? I\u2019ve no money for entertaining. I shall\ncertainly not spend my housekeeping money on\nyour visitors.\u201d\n\n\u2018No, you prefer spending it on dress and other\nuseless things.\u201d\n\n*\u201cDo you call the things I make for you useless ?\nIs a smoking-cap useless? Are slippers useless ?\nTell me! Tell me candidly !\u201d\n\nShe was an adept in formulating her questions in\nsuch a way that the reply was bound to be crushing\nfor the person who had to answer them. She was\nmerely copying her husband\u2019s method. If he wanted\nto avoid tiaing crushed, he was compelled to keep\nchanging the subject of conversation.\n\n\u2018\u201c* But I really have a very good reason for enter-\ntaining a few guests to-night,\u2019\u2019 he said with a show\nof emotion; \u201cmy old friend, Fritz Levin, of the\nPost Office, has been promoted after nineteen years\u2019\nservice\u2014I read it in the Postal] Gazette last night.\nBut as you disapprove, and as I always give way\nto you, I shall let the matter drop, and shall merely\nask Levin and schoolmaster Nystr\u00e9m to a little\nsupper in the counting-house.\u201d\u2019\n", "\u201cSo that loafer Levin has been promoted? I\nnever! Perhaps now he'll pay you back all the\nmoney he owes you ?\u201d\n\n\u201cTI hope so!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT can\u2019t understand how on earth you can have\nanything to do with that man! And the school-\nmaster! Beggars, both of them, who hardly own\nthe clothes they wear.\u201d\n\n**T say, old girl, I never interfere in your affairs ;\nleave my business alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cTf you have guests downstairs, I don\u2019t see why\nI shouldn\u2019t have friends up here ! \u201d\n\n\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you ? \u201d\u2019\n\n** All right, little lubber, give me some money then.\u201d\n\nThe little lubber, in every respect pleased with\nthe turn matters had taken, obeyed with pleasure.\n\n\u201cHow much? I\u2019ve very little cash to-\nday.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Fifty\u2019ll do.\u201d\n\n** Are you mad ?\u201d\n\n\u2018*Mad ? Give me what I ask for. Why should\nI starve when you feast ?\u201d\u2019\n\nPeace was established and the parties separated\nwith mutual satisfaction. There was no need for\nhim to lunch badly at home ; he was compelled to go\nout ; no necessity to eat a poor dinner and be made\nuncomfortable by the presence of ladies; he was\nembarrassed in the company of women, for he had\nbeen a bachelor too long; no reason to be troubled\nby his conscience, for his wife would not be alone at\nhome; as it happened she wanted to invite her\nown friends and rid of him\u2014it was worth fifty\ncrowns.\n\nAs soon as her husband had gone, Mrs. Falk\nrang the bell ; she had stayed in bed all the morning\nto punish the housemaid, for the girl had remarked\nthat in the old days everybody used to be up at seven.\nShe asked for paper and ink and sve a note\nto Mrs. Homan, the controller\u2019s wife, who lived in\nthe house opposite.\n", "Dear Evetyn\u2014the letter ran :\n\nCome in this evening and have a cup of tea with\nme; we can then discuss the statutes of the \u201c Asso-\nciation for the Rights of Women.\u201d\u2019 Possibly a bazaar\nor amateur theatricals would help us on. I am\nlonging to set the association going; it is an urgent\nneed, as you so often said ; I feel it very deeply when\nI think about it. Do you think that her Ladyship\nwould honour my house at the same time ? Perhaps\nI ought to call on her first. Come and fetch me\nat twelve and we'll have a cup of chocolate at a\neonfectioner\u2019s. My husband is away.\n\nYours affectionately,\nEUGENIA.\n\nP.S. My husband is away.\n\nWhen she had despatched the letter, she got up\nand dressed, so as to i ready at twelve.\n\nIt was evening.\n\nThe eastern end of Long Street was already\nplunged in twilight, when the clock of the German\nchurch struck seven; only a faint ray of light from\nPig Street fell into Falk\u2019s flax-shop, as Andersson\nmade ready to close it for the night. The shutters\nin the counting-house had already been fastened and\nthe gas was lighted. \u2018The place had becn swept and\nstraightened ; two hampers with protruding necks\nof bottles, sealed red and yellow, some covered with\ntinfoil and others wrapped in pink tissue paper,\nwere standing close to the door. The centre of the\nroom was taken up by a table covered with a white\ncloth ; on it stood an Indian bow] and a heavy silver\ncandelabrum.\n\nNicholas Falk paced up and down. He was wearing\na black frock-ecoat, and had a respectable as well as\na festive air. He had a right to look forward to a\npleasant evening: he had arranged it; he had paid\nfor it; he was in his own house and at his ease, for\nthere were no ladies present, and his invited guests\nwere of a calibre which justified him in expecting\n", "from them not only attention and civility, but a\nlittle more.\n\nThey were only two, but he did not like many\npeople; they were his friends, reliable, devoted as\ndogs; submissive, agreeable, always flattering and\nnever contradicting him.\n\nBeing a man of means, he could have moved in\nbetter circles; he might have associated with his\nfather\u2019s friends, and he did so, twice a year; but he\nwas of too despotic a nature to get on with them.\n\nIt was three minutes past seven and still the guests\nhad not arrived. Falk began to show signs of im-\npatience. When he invited his henchmen, he ex-\npected them to be punctual to the minute. The\nthought of the unusually sumptuous arrangement,\nhowever, and the paralysing impression it was\nbound to make, helped him to contro] his temper\na little longer ; at the lapse of a few more moments\nFritz Levin, the post-office official put in an appear-\nance.\n\n** Good-evening, brother\u2014oh ! Isay !\u201d\u2019 He paused\nin the action of divesting himself of his overcoat,\nand feigned surprise at the magnificent preparations ;\nhe almost seemed in danger of falling on his back\nwith sheer amazement. \u201cThe seven-armed candle-\nstick, and the tabernacle! Good Lord!\u201d he\nejaculated, catching sight of the hampers.\n\nThe individual who delivered these well-rehearsed\nwitticisms while taking off his overcoat, was a middle-\naged man of the type of the government official of\ntwenty years ago ; his whiskers joined his moustache,\nhis hair was parted at the side and arranged in a\ncoup de vent. He was extremely pale and as thin\nas a shroud. In spite of being well dressed, he\nwas shivering with cold and seemed to have secret\ntraffic with poverty.\n\nFalk\u2019s manner in welcoming him was both rude\nand patronizing ; it was partly intended to express\nhis scorn of flattery, more particularly from an\nindividual like the newcomer, and partly to intimate\n", "ee the newcomer enjoyed the privilege of his friend-\n\nship.\n\nby way of congratulation he began to draw a\nparallel between Levin\u2019s promotion and his own\nfather\u2019s receiving a commission in the militia.\n\n\u201c Well, it\u2019s a grand thing to have the royal mandate\nin one\u2019s pocket, isn\u2019t it? My father, too, received\na royal mandate... .\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cPardon me, dear brother, but I\u2019ve only been\nappointed.\u201d\n\n\u2018** Appointed or royal mandate, it comes to the\nsame thing. Don\u2019t teach me! My father, too, had\na royal mandate... .\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cT assure you... .\u201d\n\n** Assure me\u2014what d\u2019you mean by that? D\u2019you\nmean to imply that I\u2019m standing here telling lies ?\nTell me, do you mean to say that I\u2019m lying ? \u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cOf course I don\u2019t! There\u2019s no need to lose\nyour temper like that !\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c\u201cVery well! You\u2019re admitting that I\u2019m not\ntelling lies, consequently you have a royal mandate.\nWhy do you talk such nonsense? My father. . . .\u201d\n\nThe pale man, in whose wake a drove of furies\nseemed to have entered the counting-house\u2014for he\ntrembled in every limb\u2014now rushed at his patron,\nfirmly resolved to get over with his business before\nthe feast began, so that nothing should afterwards\ndisturb the general enjoyment.\n\n\u2018*Help me,\u201d he groaned, with the despair of a\ndrowning man, taking a bill out of his pocket.\n\nFalk sat down on the sofa. shouted for Andersson,\nordered him to open the bottles and began to mix\nthe bowl.\n\n\u201cHelp you? Haven\u2019t I helped you before?\u201d\nhe replied. \u2018\u2018 Haven\u2019t you borrowed from me again:\nand again without paying me back? Answer me!\nWhat have you got to say ?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018I know, brother, that you have always been\nkindness itself to me.\u201d\n\n*\u201c And now you\u2019ve been promoted, haven\u2019t you ?\n", "Everything was to be all right now; all debts were\nto be paid and a new life was to begin. I\u2019ve listened\nto this kind of talk for eighteen years. What salary\ndo you draw now ?\u201d\n\n\u2018*\u201c Twelve hundred crowns instead of eight hundred\nas before. But now, think of this: the cost\nof the mandate was one hundred and _ twenty-\nfive; the pension fund deducts fifty; that makes\none hundred and seventy-five. Where I am to take\nitfrom ? But the worst of it all is this : my creditors\nhave seized half my salary; consequently I have\nnow only six hundred crowns to live on instead\nof eight hundred\u2014and I\u2019ve waited nineteen years\nfor that. Promotion is a splendid thing ! \u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cWhy did you get into debt ? One ought never\nto get into debt. Fier stint debt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith a salary of eight hundred crowns all these\nyears! How was it possible to keep out of it ?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cIn that case you had no business to be in ihe\nemploy of the Government. But this is a matter\nwhich doesn\u2019t concern me; doesn\u2019t\u2014conecern\u2014\nme.\n\n*\u201c Won\u2019t you sign once more? For the last time ? \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c\u201cYou know my principles; I never sign bills.\nPlease let the matter drop.\u201d\u2019\n\nLevin, who was evidently used to these refusals,\ncalmed down. At the same moment schoolmaster\nNystr\u00e9m entered, and, to the relief of both parties,\ninterrupted the conversation. He was a dried-up\nindividual of mysterious appearance and age. His\noccupation, too, was mysterious; he was supposed\nto be a master at a school in one of the southern\nsuburbs\u2014nobody ever asked which school and he\ndid not care to talk about it. His mission, so far\nas Falk was concerned, was first to be addressed\nas schoolmaster when there were other people present ;\nsecondly, to be polite and submissive; thirdly, to\nborrow a little every now and then; never exceeding\na fiver; it was one of Falk\u2019s fundamental needs that\npeople should borrow money from him occasionally,\n", "only a little, of course ; and, fourthly, to write verses\non festive occasions; and the latter was not the\nleast of the component parts of his mission.\n\nCharles Nicholas Falk sat enthroned on his leather\nsofa, very conscious of the fact that it was his leather\nsofa, surrounded by his staff; or his dogs, as one\nmight have said. Levin found everything splendid ;\nthe bowl, the glasses, the ladle, the cigars\u2014the\nwhole box had been taken from the mantelpiece\u2014\nthe matches, the ash-trays, the bottles, the corks,\nthe wire\u2014everything. The schoolmaster looked\ncontent ; he was not called upon to talk, the other\ntwo did that ; he was merely required to be present\nas a witness in case of need.\n\nFalk was the first to raise his glass and drink\u2014\nnobody knew to whom\u2014but the schoolmaster, be-\nlieving it to be to the hero of the day, produced\nhis verses and began to read \u2018\u201c\u2018 To Fritz Levin on\nthe Day of his Promotion.\u201d\n\nFalk was attacked by a violent cough which\ndisturbed the reading and spoiled the effect of the\nwittiest points; but Nystr\u00e9m, who was a shrewd\nman and had foreseen this, had introduced into\nhis poem the finely felt and finely expressed reflec-\ntion: \u2018\u2018 What would have become of Fritz Levin\nif Charles Nicholas hadn\u2019t befriended him?\u201d This\nsubtle hint at the numerous loans made by Falk\nto his friend, soothed the cough; it subsided and\nensured a better reception to the last verse which\nwas quite impudently dedicated to Levin, a tactless-\nness which again threatened to disturb the harmony.\nFalk emptied his glass as if he were draining a cup\nfilled to the brim with ingratitude.\n\n\u2018\u201cYou\u2019re not up to the mark, Nystr\u00e9m,\u2019\u2019 he\nsaid.\n\n\u201cNo, he was far wittier on your thirty-eighth\nbirthday,\u201d agreed Levin, guessing what Falk was\ndriving at.\n\nFalk\u2019s glance penetrated into the most hidden\nrecesses of Levin\u2019s soul, trying to discover whether\n", "any lie or fraud lay hidden there\u2014and as his eyes\nwere blinded by pride, he saw nothing.\n\n** Quite true,\u201d he acquiesced: \u2018I never heard\nanything more witty in all my life; it was good\nenough to be printed; you really ought to get your\nthings Sinted. I say, Nystr\u00e9m, surely you know\nit by heart, don\u2019t you ?\u201d\u2019\n\nNystr\u00e9m had a shocking memory, or, to tell the\ntruth, he had not yet had enough wine to commit\nthe suggested outrage against decency and good form ;\nhe asked for time. But Falk, irritated by his quiet\nresistance, had gone too far to turn back, and insisted\non his request. He was almost sure that he had a\ncopy of the verses with him ; he searched his pocket-\nbook and behold! There they lay. Modesty did\nnot forbid him to read them aloud himself; it would\nnot have been for the first time; but it sounded\nbetter for anothertoreadthem. The poor dog bit his\nchain, but it held. He was a sensitive man, this\nschoolmaster, but he had to be brutal if he did\nnot want to relinquish the precious gift of life, and\nhe had been very brutal. The most private affairs\nwere fully and openly discussed, everything in\nconnexion with the birth of the hero, his reception\ninto the community, his education and up-bringing\nwere made fun of; the verses would have disgusted\neven Falk himself if they had treated of any other\n\u201coie but the fact of their celebrating him and\nis doings made them excellent. When the recita-\ntion was over, his health was drunk uproariously,\nin many glasses, for each member of the little party\nfelt that he was too sober to keep his real feelings\nunder control.\n\nThe table was now cleared and an excellent supper\nconsisting of oysters, birds, and other good things,\nwas served. Falk went sniffing from dish to dish,\nsent one or two of them back, took care that the\nchill was taken off the stout, and that the wines\nwere the right temperature. Now his dogs were\nealled upon to do their work and offer him a pleasant\n", "spectacle. When everybody was ready, he pulled out\nhis gold watch and held it in his hand while he\njestingly asked a question which his convives had\nheard many times\u2014so very many times :\n\n\u201cWhat is the time by the silver watches of the\ngentlemen ? \u201d\n\nThe anticipated reply came as in duty bound,\naccompanied by gay laughter: the watches were\nat the watch-maker\u2019s. This put Falk into the best\nof tempers, which found expression in the not at\nall unexpected joke :\n\n\u201c The animals will be fed at eight.\u201d\n\nHe sat down, poured out three liqueurs, took one\nand invited his friends to follow his example.\n\n\u2018** T must make a beginning myself, as you both seem\nto be holding back. Don\u2019t let\u2019s stand on ceremony !\nTuck in boys!\u201d\n\nThe feeding began. Charles Nicholas who was not\nparticularly hungry, had plenty of time to enjoy\nthe appetite of his guests, and he continually urged\nthem to eat. An unspeakably benevolent smile\nradiated from his bright, sunny countenance as he\nwatched their zeal, and it was difficult to say what\nhe enjoyed more, the fact of their having a good\nmeal, or the fact of their being so hungry. He\nsat there like a coachman on his box, clicking his\ntongue and cracking his whip at them.\n\n** Kat, Nystr\u00e96m! You don\u2019t know when you'll get\na meal next. Help yourself, Levin; you look as\nif you could do with a little flesh on your bones.\nAre you grinning at the oysters? Aren\u2019t they good\nenough for a fellow like you? What do you say?\nTake another! Don\u2019t be shy! What do you say ?\nYou\u2019vehadenough? Nonsense! Haveadrinknow!\nTake some stout, boys! Now a little more salmon !\nYou shall take another piece, by the Lord Harry,\nyou shall! Go on eating! Why the devil don\u2019t\nyou? It costs you nothing!\u201d\n\nWhen the birds had been carved, Charles Nicholas\npoured out the claret with a certain solemnity. The\n", "guests paused, anticipating a speech. The host\nraised his glass, smelt the bouquet of the wine and\nsaid with profound gravity :\n\n\u201cYour health, you hogs !\u201d\n\nNystr\u00e9m responded by raising his glass and\ndrinking ; but Levin left his untouched, looking\nas if he were secretly sharpening a knife.\n\nWhen supper was over Levin, strengthened by\nfood and drink, his senses befogged by the fumes\nof the wine, began to nurse a feeling of independence ;\na strong yearning for freedom stirred in his heart.\nHis voice grew more resonant; he pronounced his\nwords with increasing assurance, and his movements\nbetrayed greater ease.\n\n\u201cGive me a cigar!\u201d he said in a commanding\ntone ; \u201c no, not a weed like these, a good one.\u201d\n\nCharles Nicholas, regarding his words as a good\njoke, obeyed.\n\n\u201cYour brother isn\u2019t here to-night,\u2019 remarked\nLevin casually. There was something ominous and\nthreatening in his voice; Falk felt it and became\nuneasy.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he said shortly, but his voice was un-\nsteady.\n\nLevin waited for a few moments before striking a\nsecond blow. One of his most lucrative occupations\nwas his interference in other people\u2019s business ;\nhe carried gossip from family to family; sowed a\ngrain of discord here and another there, merely to play\nthe grateful part of the mediator afterwards. In\nthis way he had obtained a great deal of influence,\nwas feared by his acquaintances, and managed them\nas if they were marionettes.\n\nFalk felt this disagreeable influence and attempted\nto shake it off; but in vain. Levin knew how to\nwhet his curiosity; and by hinting at more than he\nknew, he succeeded in bluffing people into betraying\ntheir secrets.\n\nAt the present moment Levin held the whip and\nhe promised himself to make his oppressor feel it,\n\nD\n", "He was still merely playing with it, but Falk was\nwaiting for the blow. He tried to change the sub-\nject of conversation. He urged his friends to drink\nand they drank. Levin grew whiter and colder as\nhis intoxication increased, and went on playing with\nhis victim.\n\n** Your wife has visitors this evening,\u201d he suddenly\nremarked.\n\n** How do you know ?\u201d asked Falk, taken aback.\n\n**T know everything,\u201d answered Levin, showing his\nteeth. It was almost true; his widely extending\nbusiness connexions compelled him to visit as many\npublic places as possible, and there he heard much ;\nnot only the things which were spoken of in his\nsociety, but also those which were discussed by others.\n\nFalk was beginning to feel afraid without knowing\nwhy, and he thought it best to divert the threatening\ndanger. He became civil, humble even, but Levin\u2019s\nboldness still increased. There was no alternative,\nhe must make a speech, remind his companions of\nthe cause of the gathering, acknowledge the hero\nof the day. There was no other escape. He was\na poor speaker, but the thing had to be done. He\ntapped against the bowl, filled the glasses, and\nrecollecting an old speech, made by his father when\nFalk became his own master, he rose and began, very\nslowly :\n\n\u201cGentlemen! I have been my own master these\neight years; I was only thirty years old... .\u201d\n\nThe change from a sitting position to a standing\none caused a rush of blood to his head; he became\nconfused; Levin\u2019s mocking glances added to his\nembarrassment. His confusion grew; the figure\nthirty seemed something so colossal that it com-\npletely disconcerted him.\n\n\u201cDid I say thirty ? I didn\u2019t\u2014mean it. I was\nin my father\u2019s employ\u2014for many years. It would\ntake too long to recount everything\u2014I suffered\nduring those years; it\u2019s the common lot. Perhaps\nyou think me selfish. . . .\u201d\n", "\u201cHear! hear!\u201d groaned Nystr6m who was\nresting his heavy head on the table.\n\nLevin puffed the smoke of his cigar in the direction\nof the speaker, as if he were spitting in his face.\n\nFalk, really intoxicated now, continued his speech ;\nhis eyes seemed to seek a distant goal without being\nable to find it.\n\n** Everybody is selfish, we all know that. Ye-es!\nMy father, who made a speech when I became my\nown master, as I was just saying\u2014\u2014\u201d\n\nHe pulled out his gold watch and took if off the\nchain. The two listeners opened their eyes wide.\nWas he going to make a present of it to Levin ?\n\n\u2018\u2018Wanded me on that occasion this gold watch\nwhich he, in his turn, had received from his father\nin the year... .\u201d\n\nAgain those dreadful figures\u2014he must refer back.\n\n\u201cThis gold watch, gentlemen, was presented to\nme, nea % cannot think without emotion of the\nmoment\u2014when I received it. Perhaps you think\nI\u2019m selfish gentlemen? I\u2019m not. I know it\u2019s not\ngood form to speak of oneself, but on such an occasion\nas this it seems very natural to glance at\u2014the past.\nI only want to mention one little incident.\u201d\n\nHe had forgotten Levin and the significance of the\nday and was under the impression that he was\ncelebrating the close of his bachelor-life. All of\na sudden he remembered the scene between himself\nand his brother, and his triumph. He felt a pressing\nneed to talk of this triumph, but he could not\nremember the details. He merely remembered having\n_- that his brother was a Hackeuaed ; he had\norgotten the chain of evidence with the exception\nof only two facts: his brother and a blackguard :\nhe tried to link them together, but they always fell\napart. His brain worked incessantly and picture\nfollowed on picture. He must tell them of a generous\naction he had done; he recollected that he had\ngiven his wife some money in the morning, and had\nallowed her to sleep as long as she liked and have\n", "breakfast in bed ; but that wasn\u2019t a suitable subject.\nHe was in an unpleasant position, but fear of a\nsilence and the two pairs of sharp eyes which followed\nhis every movement, helped him to pull himself\ntogether. He realized that he was still standing,\nwatch in hand. The watch? How had it got into\nhis hand? Why were his friends sitting down,\nalmost blotted out by the smoke, while he was on\nhis legs? Oh! of course! He had been telling\nthem about the watch, and they were waiting for\nthe continuation of the story.\n\n\u201cThis watch, gentlemen, is nothing special at all.\nIt\u2019s only French gold.\u201d\n\nThe two whilom owners of silver watches opened\ntheir eyes wide. This information was new to them.\n\n\u201c\u201cAnd I believe it has only seven rubies\u2014it\u2019s\nnot a good watch at all\u2014on the contrary\u2014I should\nrather cal] it a cheap one. . . .\u201d\n\nSome secret cause of which his brain was hardly\nconscious, made him angry; he must vent his\nwrath on something; tapping the table with his\nwatch, he shouted :\n\n**Tt\u2019s a damned bad watch, I say! Listen to me\nwhen I\u2019m speaking! Don\u2019t you believe what I say,\nFritz ? Answer me! Why do you look so vicious ?\nYou don\u2019t believe me. I can read it in your eyes.\nFritz, you don\u2019t believe what I\u2019m saying. Believe\nme, I know human nature. And I might stand\nsecurity for you once more! Either you are a liar, or\nIam! Shall I prove to you that you are a scoundrel ?\nShall 1? Listen, Nystr\u00e9m, if\u2014I\u2014forge a bill\u2014am I\na scoundrel] ?\u201d\n\n\u2018Of course you are a scoundrel, the devil take you!\u201d\nanswered Nystr\u00e9m, without a moment\u2019s hesitation.\n\n*\u201c\u201c'Yes\u2014Yes !\u201d\n\nHis efforts to remember whether Levin had forged\na bill, or was in any way connected with a bill, were in\nvain. Therefore he was obliged to let the matter\ndrop. Levin was tired; he was also afraid that\nhis victim might lose consciousness, and that he and\n", "Nystr\u00e9m would be robbed of the pleasure of enjoying\nhis intended discomfiture. He therefore interrupted\nFalk with a jest in his host\u2019s own style.\n\n** Your health, old rascal !\u201d\n\nAnd down came the whip. He produced a news-\npaper.\n\n\u201cHave you seen the People\u2019s Flag?\u201d he asked\nFalk in cold murderous accents.\n\nFalk stared at the scandalous paper but said\nnothing. The inevitable was bound to happen.\n\n\u201cTt contains a splendid article on the Board of\nPayment of Employ\u00e9s\u2019 Salaries.\u201d\n\nFalk\u2019s cheeks grew white.\n\n\u00abRumour has it that your brother wrote it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie! My brother\u2019s no scandal-monger !\nHe isn\u2019t! D\u2019you hear?\u201d\n\n** But unfortunately he had to suffer for it. I\u2019m\ntold he\u2019s been sacked.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie!\u201d\n\n** I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s true. Moreover, I saw him dining\nto-day at the \u2018 Brass-Button \u2019 with a rascally look-\ning chap. I\u2019m sorry for the lad.\u201d\n\nIt was the worst blow that could have befallen\nCharles Nicholas. He was disgraced. His name,\nhis father\u2019s name, was dishonoured; all that the\nold burgesses had achieved had been in vain. If\nhe had been told that his wife had died, he could\nhave borne up under it; a financial loss, too, might\nhave been repaired. If he had been told that his\nfriend Levin, or Nystr\u00e9m, had been arrested for\nforgery, he would have disowned them, for he had\nnever shown himself in public in their company.\nBut he could not deny his relationship to his brother.\nAnd his brother had disgraced him. \u2018There was no\ngetting away from the fact.\n\nLevin had found a certain pleasure in retailing his\ninformation. Falk, although he had never given\nhis brother the smallest encouragement, was in the\nhabit of boasting of him and his achievements to his\nfriends. \u2018My brother, the assessor, is a man of\n", "brains, and he'll go far, mark my words!\u2019 These\ncontinual indirect reproaches had long been a source\nof irritation to Levin, more particularly as Charles\nNicholas drew a definite, unsurpassable, although\nindefinable, line between assessors and secretaries.\n\nLevin, without moving a finger in the matter, had\nhad his revenge at so little cost to himself that\nhe could afford to be generous, and play the part of\nthe comforter.\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cThere\u2019s no reason why you should take it so\nmuch to heart. Even a journalist can be a decent\nspecimen of humanity, and you exaggerate the\nscandal. There can be no scandal where no definite\nindividuals have been attacked. Moreover, the\nwhole thing\u2019s very witty, and evcrybody\u2019s reading\nit.\u201d\n\nThis last pe of comfort made Falk furious.\n\n**He\u2019s robbed me of my goodname! My name!\nHow can I show myself to-morrow at the Exchange ?\nWhat will people say ? \u201d\n\nBy Mort is meant his wife. She would enjoy\nthe situation because it would make the misalliance\nless marked. Heneeforth they would be on the same\nsocial level. The thought was intolerable. <A bitter\nhatred for all mankind took possession of his soul.\nIf only he had been the bastard\u2019s father! Then\nhe could have made use of his parental privilege,\nwashed his hands cf him, cursed him, and so have\nput an end to the matter: put there was no such\nthing as a brotherly privilege. Was it possible\nthat he himself, was partly to blame for the disgrace ?\nHad he not forced his brother into his profession ?\nMaybcethe scene of the morning or his brother\u2019s financial\ndifficulties\u2014caused by him\u2014were to blame? No! he\nhad never committed a base action; he was blame-\nless; he was respected and looked up to; he was\nno seandal-monger; he had never been sacked by\nanybody. Did he not carry a paper in his pocket-\nbook, testifying that he was the kindest friend with\nthe kindest heart ? Had not the schoolmaster read\n", "it aloud a little while ago? Yes, certainly\u2014and he\nsat down to drink, drink immoderately\u2014not to stupefy\nhis conscience, there was no necessity for that, he\nhad done no wrong, but merely to drown his anger.\nBut it was no use; it boiled over\u2014and scalded those\nwho sat nearest to him.\n\n\u201cDrink, you rascals! That brute there\u2019s asleep !\nAnd you call yourselves friends! Waken him up,\nLevin !\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018\u201c* Whom are you shouting at ?\u2019\u201d\u2019 asked the offended\nLevin peevishly.\n\n** At you, of course!\u201d\n\nTwo glances were exchanged across the table\nwhich promised no good. Falk, whose temper\nimproved directly he saw another man in a rage,\npoured a ladleful of the contents of the bowl on the\nschoolmaster\u2019s head, so that it trickled down his\nneck behind his collar.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t dare to do that again!\u2019 threatened\nLevin.\n\n\u201c\u201c Who\u2019s to prevent me ?\u201d\n\n\u201cI! Yes, I! I shan\u2019t let you ruin his clothes.\nIt\u2019s a beastly shame ! \u201d\n\n\u201cHis clothes,\u201d laughed Falk. \u2018\u2018Isn\u2019t it my coat ?\nDidn\u2019t I give it to him ? \u201d\n\n\u201cYou're going too far!\u201d said Levin, rising to go.\n\n\u201cSo you're going now! You\u2019ve had enough to\neat, you can\u2019t drink any more, you don\u2019t want me\nany-longer to-night. Didn\u2019t you want to borrow a\nfiver? What? Am I to be deprived of the honour\nof lending you some money? Didn\u2019t you want me\nto sign something ? Sign, eh ?\u201d\u2019\n\nAt the word sign, Levin pricked up his ears.\nSupposing he tried to get the better of him in his\nexcited condition ? The thought softened him.\n\n\u201c\u201cDon\u2019t be unjust, brother,\u2019? he re-commenced.\n\u201cT\u2019m not ungrateful; I fully appreciate your kind-\nness; but I\u2019m poor, poorer than you\u2019ve ever been,\nor ever can be; I\u2019ve suffered humiliations which you\ncan\u2019t even conceive; but I\u2019ve always looked upon\n", "you as a friend. I mean a friend in the highest\nsense of the word. You\u2019ve had too much to drink\nto-night and so you\u2019re cross ; this makes you unjust,\nbut I assure you, gentlemen, in the whole world there\nbeats no kinder heart than that of Charles Nicholas.\nAnd I don\u2019t say this for the first time. I thank you\nfor your courtesy to-night, that is to say, if the\nexcellent supper we have eaten, the magnificent wines\nwe have drunk, have been eaten and drunk in my\nhonour. I thank you, brother, and drink your\nhealth. Here\u2019s to you, brother Charles Nicholas !\nThank you, thank you a thousand times! You've\nnot done it in vain! Mark my words!\u201d\n\nStrange to say, these words, spoken in a tremulous\nvoice\u2014tremulous with emotion\u2014 produced good\nresults. Falk felt good. Hadn\u2019t he again been\nassured that he had a kind heart? He firmly\nbelieved it.\n\nThe intoxication had reached the sentimental\nstage; they moved nearer together; they talked\nof their good qualities, of the wickedness of the\nworld, the warmth of their feelings, the strength\nof their good intentions ; they grasped cach other\u2019s\nhands. Falk spoke of his wife; of his kindness to\nher; he regretted the lack of spirituality in his\ncalling ; he mentioned how painfully aware he was\nof his want of culture; he said that his life was a\nfailure; and after the consumption of his tenth\nliqueur, he confided to Levin that it had been his\nambition to go into the church, become a missionary,\neven. They grew more and more spiritual. Levin\nspoke of his dead mother, her death and funeral,\nof an unhappy love-aflair, and finally of his religious\nconvictions, as a rule jealously guarded as a secret.\nAnd soon they were launched on an eager discussion\nof religion.\n\nIt struck one\u2014it struck two\u2014and they were still\ntalking while Nystr\u00e9m slept soundly, his arms on the\ntable, and his head resting on his arms. A dense\ncloud of tobacco smoke filled the counting-house and\n", "robbed the gas flames of their brilliancy. \u2018The seven\ncandles of the seven-armed candelabrum had burnt\ndown to the sockets and the table presented a dismal\nsight. One or two glasses had lost their stems, the\nstained tablecloth was covered with cigar ash, the\nfloor was strewn with matches. The daylight was\nbreaking through the chinks of the shutters; its\nshafts pierced the cloud of smoke and drew cabbalistic\nfigures on the tablecloth between the two champions\nof their faith, busily engaged in re-editing theAugsburg\nConfession. They were now talking with hissing\nvoices ; their brains were numbed; their words sounded\ndry, the tension was relaxing in spite of their diligent\nrecourse to the bottle. \u2018They tried to whip up their\nsouls into an ecstasy, but their efforts grew weaker\nand weaker; the spirit had died out of their con-\nversation; they only exchanged meaningless words ;\nthe stupefied brains which had been whirling round\nlike teetotums, slackened in their speed and finally\nstopped; one thought alone filled their minds\u2014\nthey must go to bed, if they did not want to loathe\nthe sight of each other ; they must be alone.\nNystr\u00e9m was shaken into consciousness; Levin\nembraced Charles Nicholas and took the opportunity\nto pocket three of his cigars. The heights which\nthey had scaled were too sublime to allow them\nto talk of the bill just yet. They parted\u2014the host\nlet his guests out\u2014he was alone! He opened the\nshutters\u2014daylight poured into the room; he opened\nthe window ; the cool sea-breeze swept through the\nnarrow street, one side of which was already illuminated\nby the rising sun. It struck four, he listened to\nthat wonderful striking only heard by the poor\nwretch who yearns for the day on a bed of sickness\nor sorrow. Even Long Street East, that street of\nvice, of filth and brawls, lay in the early morning\nsun, still, desolate and pure. Falk felt deeply\nunhappy. He was disgraced\u2014he was lonely! He\nclosed window and shutters, and as he turned round\nand beheld the state of the room, he at once began\n", "setting it straight. He picked up the cigar ends\nand threw them into the grate; he eleared the\ntable, swept the room, dusted it and put everything\nin its place. He washed his face and hands, and brushed\nhis hair; a policeman might have thought him a\nmurderer, intent on effacing all traces of his crime.\nBut all the while he thought, clearly, firmly and\nlogically. When he had straightened the room and\nhimself, he formed a resolution, long brooded over,\nbut now to be carried into effect. He would wipe away\nthe disgrace which had fallen on his family; he\nwould rise in the world and become a well-known\nand influential man; he would begin a new life;\nhe would keep his reputation unstained and _ he\nwould make his name respected. He felt that\nonly a great ambition could help him to keep his\nhead erect after the blow he had received to-night.\nAmbition had been latent in his heart; it had been\nawakened and henceforth it should rule his life.\n\nQuite sober now, he lighted a cigar, drank a brandy,\nand went upstairs, quietly, gently, so as not to disturb\nhis sleeping wife.\n", "CHAPTER V\n\nAT THE PUBLISHER\u2019S\nArvip Fak decided. to try Smith first, the almighty\nSmith\u2014a name adopted by the publisher in his\nyouth during a short trip to the great continent,\nfrom exaggerated admiration of everything American\n\u2014the redoubtable Smith with his thousand arms who\ncould make a writer in twelve months, however bad\nthe original material. His method was well known,\nthough none but he dared to make use of it, for it\nrequired an unparalleled amount of impudence.\nThe writer whom he took up could be sure of making\n@ name; hence Smith was overrun with nameless\nwriters.\n\nThe following story is told as an instance of his\nirresistible power and capacity for starting an author\non the vad to fame. A young, inexperienced writer\nsubmitted his first nove], a bad one, to Smith. For\nsome reason the latter happened to like the first\nchapter\u2014he never read more\u2014and decided to bless\nthe world witha new author. The book was published\nbearing on the back of the cover the words: \u2018* Blood\nand Sword. A novel by Gustay Sj\u00e9holm. This\nwork of the young and promising author whose\nhighly respected name has for a long time been\nfamiliar to the widest circles, etc. etc. It is a book\nwhich we can strongly recommend to the novel-\nreading public.\u201d The book was published on April 3.\nOn April 4, a review appeared in the widely read\nmetropolitan paper the Grey Bonnet, in which\nSmith held fifty shares. It concluded by saying:\n\u201cGustav Sj\u00e9holm\u2019s name is already well known ;\n\n59\n", "the spreading of his fame does not lic with us; and\nwe recommend this book not only to the novel- |\nreading, but also to the novel-writing public.\u201d\u2019 On\nApril 5 an advertisement appeared in every paper\nof the capital with the following quotation : \u2018* Gustav\nSjoholm\u2019s name is already well known ; the spreading\nof his fame does not lie with us. (Grey Bonnet).\u201d\u2019\nOn the same evening a notice appeared in the In-\ncorruptible, a paper read by nobody. It represented\nthe book as a model of bad literature, and the re-\nviewer swore that Gustav Sj\u00e9blom (reviewer's in-\ntentional slip), had no name at all. But as nobody\nread the Incorruptible, the opposition remained un-\nheard. The other papers, unwilling to disagree with\nthe venerable leading Grey Bonnet, and afraid of\noffending Smith, were mild in their criticisms, but\nno more. They held the view that with hard work\nGustav Sj\u00e9holm might make a name for himself in\nthe future. A few days of silence followed, but in\nevery paper\u2014in the IJncorruptible in bold type\u2014\nappeared the advertisement, shouting: \u2018\u2018 Gustav\nSjGholm\u2019s name is already well known.\u201d Then a\ncorrespondence was started in the X-k\u00e9pings Mis-\ncellaneous, reproaching the metropolitan papers with\nbeing hard on young authors. \u2018* Gustav Sj\u00e9holm is\nsimply a genius,\u201d\u2019 affirmed the hot-headed correspon-\ndent, \u2018\u201c\u2018 in spite of all that dogmatic blockheads might\nsay to the contrary.\u201d\u201d On the next day the adver-\ntisement again appeared in all the papers, bawling :\n\u201cGustav Sj\u00e9holm\u2019s name is already well known, etc.\n(Grey Bonnet).\u201d \u2018* Gustav Sj\u00e9holm is a genius, ete.\n(X-k\u00e9pings Miscellaneous).\u201d\u2019 The cover of the next\nnumber of the magazine Our Land, one of Smith\u2019s\npublications, bore the notice: \u201c We are pleased\nto be in a position to inform our numerous subscribers\nthat the brilliant young author Gustav Sj\u00e9holm\nhas promised us an original novel for our next\nnumber, ete.\u2019? And then again the advertisement in\nthe papers. Finally, when at Christmas the almanac\nOur People appeared, the authors mentioned on the\n", "title page were: Orvar Odd, Talis Qualis, Gustav\nSjoholm, and others, It was a fact. In the eighth\nmonth Gustav Sjcholm was made. And the public\nwas powerless. It had to swallow him. It was\nimpossible to go into a bookseller\u2019s and look at a\nbook without reading his name; impossible to take\nup a newspaper without coming across it. In all\ncircumstances and conditions of life that name\nobtruded itself, printed on a slip of paper; it was\nput into the housewives\u2019 market baskets on Saturdays ;\nthe servants carried it home from the tradespeople ;\nthe crossing-sweeper swept it off the street, and the\nman of leisure went about with it in the pockets of\nhis dressing-gown.\n\nBeing well aware of Smith\u2019s great power, the young\nman climbed the dark stairs of the publisher\u2019s house\nclose to the Great Church, not without misgivings.\nHe had to wait for a long time in an outer office,\na prey to the most unpleasant meditations, until\nRddenly the door was burst open and a young man\nrushed out of an inner office, despair on his face and\na roll of paper under his arm. Shaking in every\nlimb, Falk entered the sanctum, where the despot\nreceived his visitors, seated on a low sofa, calm and\nserene as a god; he kindly nodded his grey head,\ncovered by a blue cap, and went on smoking, peace-\nfully, as if he had never shattered a man\u2019s hopes or\nturned an unhappy wretch from his door.\n\n\u201cGood morning, sir, good morning ! \u201d\n\nHis divinely flashing eyes glanced at the new-\ncomer\u2019s clothes and approved; nevertheless he did\nnot ask him to sit down.\n\n\u201cMy name is\u2014Falk.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnknown to me! What is your father ?\u201d\n\n*\u201c* My father is dead.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he 2? Good! What can I do for you, sir?\u201d\n\nFalk produced a manuscript from his breast\npocket and handed it to Smith; the latter sat on it\nwithout looking at it.\n\n\u201cYou want me to publish it? Verse? I might\n", "have guessed it! Do you know the cost of printing\na single page, sir? No, you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAnd he playfully poked the ignoramus with the\nstem of his pipe.\n\n\u2018\u2018 Have you made a name, sir? No! Have you\ndistinguished yourself in any way ? No!\u201d\n\n** The Academy has praised these verses.\u201d\n\n** Which Academy ? The Academy of Sciences ?\nThe one which publishes all that stuff about flints ? \u201d\n\n* About flints ? \u201d\u2019\n\n** Yes, you know the Academy of Sciences! Close\nto the Museum, near the river. Well, then! \u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, Mr. Smith! The Swedish Academy, ia\nthe Exchange. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cT see! The one with the tallow candles!\nNever mind ; no man on earth can tell what purpose\nit serves! No, my dear sir, the essential thing is to\nhave a name, a name like Tegn\u00e9r, like Ohrenschligel,\nlike\u2014Yes! Our country has many great poets, but\nI can\u2019t remember them just at the moment; but a\nname is necessary. Mr. Falk? H\u2019m! Who knows\nMr. Falk ? I don\u2019t, and I know many great poets.\nAs I recently said to my friend Ibsen: \u2018 Now just\nyou listen to me, Ibsen\u2019\u2014I call him Ibsen, quite\nplainly\u2014 \u2018just you listen to me, write something for\nmy magazine. Ill pay you whatever you ask!\u2019\nHe wrote\u2014I paid\u2014but I got my money back.\u201d\n\nThe annihilated young man longed to sink through\nthe chinks in the floor when he realized that he was\nstanding before a person who called Ibsen quite\nplainly \u2018\u2018 Ibsen.\u201d He longed to recover his manu-\nscript, and go his way, as the other young man had\ndone, away, far away, until he came to running water.\nSmith guessed it.\n\n** Well, I\u2019ve no doubt you can write Swedish, sir.\nAnd you know our literature better than I do. Good !\nI have an idea. I am told of great, beautiful,\nspiritual writers who lived in the past, let\u2019s say in\nthe reign of Gustav Eriksson and his daughter\nChristina. Isn\u2019t that so?\u201d\n", "\u2018* Gustavus Adolfus.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cGustavus Adolfus, so be it! I remember there\nwas one with a great, a very great name; he wrote\na fine work in verse, on God\u2019s Creation, I believe!\nHis Christian name was Hokan ! \u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean Haquin Spegel, Mr. Smith! \u2018 God\u2019s\nWorks and Rest.\u2019 \u201d\n\n* Ah, yes! Well, I\u2019ve been thinking of publishing\nit. Our nation is yearning for religion these days ;\nI\u2019ve noticed that; and one must give the people\nsomething. I have given them a good deal of\nHermann Francke and Arndt, but the great Founda-\ntion can sell more cheaply than I can, and now I want\nto bring out something good at a fair price. Will\nyou take the matter in hand ?\u201d\n\n**T don\u2019t know where I come in, as it is but a\nquestion of a reprint,\u201d\u2019 answered Falk, not daring to\nrefuse straight out.\n\n\u201cDear me, what ignorance! You would do the\nediting and proof-reading, of course. Are we agreed ?\nYou publish it, sir! What? Shall we draw up a\nlittle agreement ? The work must appear in numbers.\nWhat? A little agreement. Just hand me pen and\nink. Well?\u201d\n\nFalk obeyed; he was unable to offer resistance.\nSmith wrote and Falk signed.\n\n\u2018Well, so much for that! Now, there\u2019s another\nthing! Give me that little book on the stand!\nThe third shelf! There! Now look here! A\nbrochure\u2014title: \u2018\u2018 The Guardian Angel.\u2019 Look at\nthe vignette! An angel with an anchor and a ship\u2014\nit\u2019s a schooner without any yards, I believe! The\nsplendid influence of marine insurance on social life\nin general is well known. Everybody has at one\ntime or other sent something more or less valuable\nacross the seainaship. What? Well! Everybody\ndoesn\u2019t realize this. No! Consequently it is our\nduty to enlighten those who are ignorant; isn\u2019t\nthat so? Well! We know, you and I; therefore\nit is for us to enlighten those who don\u2019t. This book\n", "maintains that everybody who sends things across\nthe water should insure them. But this book is\nbadly written. Well! We'll write a better one.\nWhat ? You'll write me a novel of ten pages for my\nmagazine Our Land, and I expect you to have\nsufficient gumption to introduce the name Triton\u2014\nwhich is the name of a new limited liability company,\nfounded by my nephew, and we are told to help our\nneighbours\u2014twice, neither more nor less; but it\nmust be done cleverly and so that it is not at all\nobvious. Do you follow me?\u201d\n\nFalk found the offer repulsive, although it con-\ntained nothing dishonest ; however, it gave him a\nstart with the influential man, straight away, without\nany effort on his part. He thanked Smith and\nwas\n\n\u201cYou know the size ? Sixteen inches to the page,\naltogether a hundred and sixty inches of eight lines\neach. Shall we write a little agreement ? \u201d\n\nSmith drew up an agreement and Falk signed.\n\n\u2018* Well, now! You know the history of Sweden ?\nGo to the stand again\u2014you will find a clich\u00e9 there,\na wood block. To the right! That\u2019s it! Can you\ntell me who the lady is meant for? She is supposed\nto be a queen.\u201d\n\nFalk, who saw nothing at first but a piece of black\nwood, finally made out some human features and\ndeclared that to the best of his belief it represented\nUlrica Eleonora.\n\n**Didn\u2019t I say so? MHihihi! The block has been\nused for Elizabeth, Queen of England, in an American\npopular edition. I\u2019ve bought it cheaply, with a\nlot of others. I\u2019m going to use it for Ulrica Eleonora\nin my People\u2019s Library. Our people are splendid ;\nthey are so ready to buy my books. Will you write\nthe letterpress ? \u201d\n\nAlthough Falk did not like the order, his super-\nsensitive conscience could find no wrong in the\nproposal.\n\n\u201cWell then! We\u2019d better make out a little\n", "agreement. Sixteen pages octavo, at three inches,\nat twenty-four lines cach. There!\u201d\n\nFalk, realizing that the audience was over, made\na movement to recover his manuscript on which\nSmith had all along been sitting. But the latter\nwould not give it up ; he declared that he would read\nit, although it might take him some time.\n\n\u201cYou're a sensible man, sir, who knows the value\nof time,\u201d he said. \u2018I had a young fellow here just\nbefore you came in; he also brought me verses, a\ngreat poem, for which I have no use. I made him\nthe same offers I just made to you, sir; do you know\nwhat he said? He told me to do something un-\nmentionable. He did, indeed, and rushed out of the\noffice. He'll not live long, that young man! Good\nday, good day! Don\u2019t forget to order a copy of\nHoken Spegel! Well, good day, good day.\u201d\n\nSmith pointed to the door with the stem of his\npipe and Falk left him.\n\nHe did not walk away with light footsteps. The\nwood-block in his pocket was heavy and weighed him\ndown, kept him back. He thought of the pale\nyoung man with the roll of manuscript who had\ndared to say a bold thing to Smith, and pride stirred\nin his heart. But memories of old paternal warnings\nand advice whispered the old lie to him that all work\nwas equally honourable, and reproved him for his\npride. He laid hold of his common sense and went\nhome to write a hundred and ninety-two inches\nabout Ulrica Eleonora.\n\nAs he had risen early he was at his writing-table\nat nine o\u2019clock. He filed a large pipe, took two\nsheets of paper, wiped his steel nibs and tried to\nrecall all he knew about Ulrica Eleonora. He looked\nher up in Ekelund and Fryxell. There was a great\ndeal under the heading Ulrica Eleonora, but very\nlittle about her personally. At half-past nine he had\nexhausted the subject. He had written down her\nbirthplace, and the place where she died, when she\ncame to the throne, when she abdicated, the names\n\nE\n", "of her parents and the name of her husband. It was\na commonplace excerpt from a church register\u2014and\nfilled three pages, leaving thirteen to be covered.\nHe smoked two or three pipes and dragged the ink-\nstand with his pen, as if he were fishing for the\nMidgard serpent, but he brought up nothing. He\nwas bound to say something about her personally,\nsketch her character ; he felt as if he were sitting in\njudgment on her. Should he praise or revile her ?\nAs it was a matter of complete indifference to him,\nhis mind was still not made up when it struck eleven.\nHe reviled her\u2014and came to the end of the fourth\npage, leaving twelve to be accounted for. He was\nat his wits\u2019 end. He wanted to say something about\nher rule, but as she had not ruled, there was nothing\nto be said. He wrote about her Council\u2014one page\u2014\nleaving eleven; he whitewashed G\u00e9rtz\u2014another\u2014\nleaving ten. He had not yet filled half the ig vole\nspace. He hated the woman! More pipes! Fresh\nsteel nibs! He went back to remoter days, passing\nthem in review, and being now in a thoroughly bad\ntemper, he overthrew his old idol, Charles XII, and\nhurled him in the dust ; it was done in a few words,\nand only added one more page to his pile. There\nstill remained nine. He anticipated events and\ncriticised Frederick I. Half a page! He glanced at\nthe paper with unhappy eyes ; he glimpsed half-way\nhouse, but could not reach it. He had written seven\nand a half small pages; Ekelund had only managed\none and a half.\n\nHe flung the wood-block on the floor, kicked it\nunderneath his writing-table, crawled after it, dusted\nit and put it in its former place. It was torture!\nHis soul was as dry as the block. He tried to work\nhimself up to views which he did not hold ; he tried\nto awaken some sort of emotion in his heart for the\ndead queen, but her plain, dull features, cut into the\nwood, made no more impression on him than he on\nthe block. He realized his incapacity and felt\ndespondent, degraded. And this was the career of\n", "his choice, the one he had preferred to all others.\nWith a strong appeal to his reason, he turned to the\nguardian angel.\n\nThe brochure was originally written for a German\nsociety, the \u2018\u2018 Nereus,\u201d and the argument was as\nfollows: Mr. and Mrs. Castle had emigrated to\nAmerica, where they acquired a large estate. To\nmake the story possible, they had sold their land,\nand, very unpractically, invested the total amount\nrealized in costly furniture and objects of art. As\nthe story required that everything should be com-\npletely lost and nothing whatever saved from the\nshipwreck, they sent off the whole lot in advance\nby the Washington, a first-class steamer, copper\nbottomed, with watertight bulkheads, and insured\nwith the great German Marine Insurance Company\nfor \u00a360,000. Mr. and Mrs. Castle and the children\nfollowed on the Bolivar, the finest boat of the White\nStar Line, insured with the great Marine Insurance\nCompany \u201cNereus\u201d (Capital $10,000,000), and\nsafely arrived at Liverpool. They left Liverpool and\nall went well until they came to Skagen Point.\nDuring the whole voyage the weather had, of course,\nbeen magnificent ; the sky was clear and radiant,\nbut at the dangerous Skagen Point a storm overtook\nthem; the steamer was wrecked; the parents,\nwhose lives were insured, were drowned, thereby\nguaranteeing to the children, who were saved, \u00a31500.\nThe latter, rejoicing at their parents\u2019 foresight,\narrived at Hamburg in good spirits, eager to take\npossession of the insurance money and the property\nwhich they had inherited from their parents. pcg\ntheir consternation when they were told that the\nWashington had been wrecked a fortnight before\ntheir arrival on Dogger Bank; their whole fortune,\nwhich had been left uninsured, was lost. All that\nremained was the life insurance money. They\nhurried to the Company\u2019s agents. A fresh disaster !\nThey were told that their parents had not paid the\nlast premium which\u2014oh, fateful blow !\u2014had been\n", "68 THE RED ROOM\n\ndue on the day preceeding their death. The distressed\nchildren bitterly mourned their parents, who had\nworked so hard for them. They embraced each other\nwith tears and made a solemn vow that henceforth\nall their possessions should be insured, and that they\nwould never neglect paying their life insurance\npremiums.\n\nThis story was to be localized, adapted to a Swedish\nenvironment and made into a readable novelette ;\nand with this he was to make his d\u00e9but in the\nliterary world. The devil of pride whispered to him\nnot to bea blackguard and to leave the business alone,\nbut this voice was silenced by another, which came\nfrom the region of his empty stomach, and was\naccompanied by a gnawing, stinging sensation. He\ndrank a glass of water and smoked another pipe.\nBut his discomfort increased. His thoughts became\nmore gloomy; he found his room uncomfortable,\nthe morning dull and monotonous ; he was tired and\ndespondent ; everything seemed repulsive ; his ideas\nwere spiritless and revolved round nothing but un-\npleasant subjects; and still his discomfort grew.\nHe wondered whether he was hungry ? It was one\no\u2019clock. He never dined before three. He anxiously\nexamined his purse. Threepence halfpenny! For\nthe first time in his life he would have to go without\ndinner! This was a trouble hitherto unknown to\nhim. But with threepence halfpenny there was no\nnecessity to starve. He could send for bread and\nbeer. No! That would not do; it was infra dig.\nGo to a dairy? No! Borrow? Impossible! He\nknew nobody who would lend. No sooner had he\nrealized this than hunger began to rage in him like\na wild beast let loose, biting him, tearing him and\nchasing him round the room. He smoked pipe after\npipe to stupefy the monster ; in vain.\n\nA rolling of drums from the barracks yard told\nhim that the guardsmen were lining up with their\ncopper vessels to receive their dinner ; every chimney\nwas smoking ; the dinner bell went in the dockyard ;\n", "a hissing sound came from his neighbour\u2019s, the\npolicemen\u2019s kitchen; the smell of roast meat\npenetrated through the chinks of the door ; he heard\nthe rattling of knives and plates in the adjacent room,\nand the children saying grace. The paviours in the\nstreet below were taking their alten dinnes nap with\ntheir heads on their empty food baskets. The whole\ntown was dining ; everybody, except he. He raged\nagainst God. But all at once a clear thought shot\nthrough his brain. He seized Ulrica Eleonora and\nthe guardian angel, wrapped them in paper, wrote\nSmith\u2019s name and address on the parcel, and handed\nthe messenger his threepence halfpenny. And with\na sigh of relief he threw himself on his sofa and\nstarved, with a heart bursting with pride.\n", "CHAPTER VI\n\nTHE RED ROOM\nTHE same afternoon sun which had witnessed Arvid\nFalk\u2019s defeat in his first battle with hunger shone\nserenely into the cottage of the artists\u2019 colony, where\nSell\u00e9n, in shirt sleeves, was standing before his easel\nworking at his picture which had to be in the\nExhibition on the following morning before ten,\nfinished, framed, and varnished. Olle Montanus sat\non the bed-sofa reading the wonderful book lent to\nhim by Ygberg for a day in exchange for his muffler ;\nbetweenwhiles he cast a look of admiration at\nSell\u00e9n\u2019s picture. He had great faith in Sell\u00e9n\u2019s\ntalent. Lundell was calmly working at his \u2018\u2018 Descent\nfrom the Cross \u201d; he had already sent three pictures\nto the Exhibition and, like many others, he was\nawaiting their sale with a certain amount of excite-\nment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, Sell\u00e9n,\u201d said Olle, \u2018\u201c\u2018 you paint\ndivinely.\u201d\n\n\u2018** May I look at your spinach ?\u201d asked Lundell,\nwho never admired anything, on principle.\n\nThe subject was simple and grand. The picture\nrepresented a stretch of drifting sand on the coast\nof Halland with the sea in the background ; it was\nfull of the feeling of autumn ; sunbeams were break-\ning through riven clouds ; the foreground was partly\ndrift sand and newly washed-up seaweed, dripping\nwet and lit by the sun; in the middle distance lay\nthe sea, with huge crested waves\u2014the greater part\nin deep shadow; but in the background, on the\nhorizon, the sun was shining, opening up a _per-\n\n70\n", "spective into infinity ; the only figures were a flock\nof birds.\n\nNo unperverted mind who had the courage to face\nthe mysterious wealth of solitude, had seen promising\nharvests choked by the drifting sand, could fail to\nunderstand the picture. It was painted with in-\nspiration and talent; the colouring was the result\nof the prevailing mood, the mood was not engendered\nby the colouring.\n\n\u201cYou must have something in the foreground,\u201d\npersisted Lundell. \u2018\u2018Take my advice.\u201d\n\n** Rubbish ! \u201d replied Sell\u00e9n.\n\n\u201cDo what I tell you, and don\u2019t be a fool, other-\nwise you won\u2019t sell. Paint in a figure; a girl by\npreference; I\u2019ll help you if you don\u2019t know how to\ndoit. Lookhere... \u201d\n\n\u201cNone of your tricks! What\u2019s the good of\npetticoats in a high wind? You\u2019re mad on petti-\ncoats |\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, do as you like,\u201d replied Lundell, a\nlittle hurt by the reference to one of his weakest\n\noints. \u2018But instead of those grey gulls you should\na painted storks. Nobody can tell what sort of\nbirds these are. Picture the red storks\u2019 legs against\nthe dark cloud! What a contrast !\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand ! \u201d\n\nSell\u00e9n was not clever in stating his motives, but\nhe was sure of his points and his sound instincts\nled him safely past all errors.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t sell,\u201d Lundell began again; his\nfriend\u2019s financial position worried him.\n\n** Well, I shall live somehow in spite of it. Have\nI ever sold anything? Am I the worse for it? Do\nSy think I don\u2019t know that I should sell if I painted\n\nike everybody else? Do you think I can\u2019t paint\nas ome as everybody else? I just don\u2019t want\nto 9\n\n\u201cBut you ought to think of paying your debts!\nYou owe Mr. Lund of the \u2018Sauce-Pan\u2019 several\nhundred crowns.\u201d\n", "\u201cWell, that won\u2019t ruin him. Moreover I gave\nhim a picture worth twice that amount.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are the most selfish man I ever met! The\npicture wasn\u2019t worth twenty crowns.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT value it at five hundred, as prices go! But\nunfortunately inclinations and tastes differ here\nbelow. I find your \u2018Crucifixion\u2019 an execrable\nperformance, you find it beautiful. Nobody can\nblame you for it. Tastes differ! \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cBut you spoilt our eredit at the \u2018 Sauce-Pan.\u2019\nMr. Lund refused to give me credit yesterday, and\nI don\u2019t know how I\u2019m to get a dinner to-day.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat does it matter? Do without it! I\nhaven\u2019t had a dinner these last two years.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou plundered Mr. Falk the other day, when he\nfell into your clutches.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cThat\u2019s true! He\u2019s a nice chap; moreover, he\nhas talent. There\u2019s much originality in his verses ;\nI have read some of them these last few evenings.\nBut I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s not hard enough to get on in\nthis world. He\u2019s too sensitive, the rascal ! \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c\u201cTf he sees much of you, he\u2019ll get over that. It\u2019s\noutrageous how you spoilt that young Rehnhjelm\nin so short a time. I hear you are encouraging him\nto go on the stage.\u201d\n\n** Did he tell you that ? The little devil! He'll\nget on if he remains alive; but that\u2019s not so simple\nwhen one has so little to eat! God\u2019s death! I\u2019ve\nno more paint ! Can you spare any white ? Merciful\nLord! All the tubes are empty! You must give\nme some, Lundell ! \u201d\n\n\u2018*T\u2019ve no more than I want for myself\u2014and even\nif I had, I should take jolly good care not to give you\nany.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop talking nonsense! You know there\u2019s no\ntime to lose!\u201d\n\n** Seriously, I haven\u2019t got your colours. If you\nweren\u2019t so wasteful your tubes would go further.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cT know that! Give me some money, then ! \u201d\n\n* Moncy, indeed! That\u2019s no go!\u201d\n", "\u201cGet up, Olle! You must go and pawn some-\nthing.\u201d\n\nAt the word pawn Olle\u2019s face brightened ; he saw\na prospect of food.\n\nSellen was searching the room.\n\n\u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s this? A pair of boots! We'll get\ntwopence halfpenny on them ; they\u2019d better be sold.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cThey\u2019re Rehnhjelm\u2019s! You can\u2019t take them,\u201d\nobjected Lundell, who had meant to put them on\nin the afternoon when he was going up to town.\n\u00ab\u00ab Surely you aren\u2019t going to take liberties with other\npeople\u2019s property ! \u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not? He'll be getting money for them.\nWhat\u2019s in this parcel? A velvet waistcoat! A\nbeauty! I shall keep it for myself and then Olle\ncan pawn mine. Collars and cuffs? Oh! paper!\nA pair of socks! Here, Olle, rag age halfpenny !\nWrap them in the waistcoat! You can sell the\nempty bottles\u2014I think the best thing would be to\nsell everything.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cDo you mean to say you are going to sell other\npeople\u2019s belongings ? Have you no sense of right\nand wrong ?\u201d\u2019 interrupted Lundell again, hoping to\ngain  cageeataan of the parcel which had long tempted\nhim, by means of persuasion.\n\n\u2018* He'll get paid for it lateron! But it isn\u2019t enough\nyet. We must take the sheets off the bed. Why\nnot? We don\u2019t want any sheets! Here, Olle,\ncram them in!\u201d\n\nOlle 7 skilfully made a bag of one of the sheets\nand stuffed everything into it, while Lundell went on\neagerly protesting.\n\nWhen the parcel was made, Olle took it under his\narm, buttoned his ragged coat so as to hide the\nabsence of a waistcoat, and set out on his way to\nthe town.\n\n\u2018* He looks like a thief,\u2019\u2019 said Sell\u00e9n, watching him\nfrom the window with a sly smile. \u201cI hope the\npolice won\u2019t interfere with him! Hurry up, Olle!\u201d\nhe shouted after the retreating figure, \u201c\u2018 Buy six\n", "French rolls and two half-pints of beer if there\u2019s\nanything over after you\u2019ve bought the paint.\u201d\n\nOlle turned round and waved his hat with as\nmuch assurance as if he had the feast already safely\nin his pockets.\n\nLundell and Sell\u00e9n were alone. Scll\u00e9n was admiring\nhis new velvet waistcoat for which Lundell had nursed\na secret passion for a long time. He scraped his\npalette and cast envious glances at the lost glory.\nBut it was something else he was trying to speak\nof; something else, which was very difficult to\nmention.\n\n\u2018\u201c*T wish you\u2019d look at my picture,\u201d\u2019 he said at last.\n** What do you think of it, seriously ? \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t draw and slave at it so much! Paint !\nWhere does the light come from ?_ From the clothes,\nfrom the flesh! It\u2019s crazy! What do these people\nbreathe ? Colour! Turpentine! I see no air!\u201d\n\n\u201c* Well,\u201d said Lundell, \u201ctastes differ, as you said\njust now. What do you think of the composition ? \u201d\n\n*'Too many people !\u201d\n\n* You\u2019re awful! I want more, not fewer.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* Let me see! There\u2019s one great mistake in it.\u201d\n\nSell\u00e9n shot a long glance at the picture, a glance\npeculiar to the inhabitants of sea-coasts and plains.\n\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re right,\u201d agreed Lundell. \u2018\u2018 You can\nsee it then ? \u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u2018'There are only men in your picture. It\u2019s some-\nwhat monotonous.\u201d\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it! But fancy, that you should sce\nthat!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a woman then? \u201d\u2019\n\nLundell looked at him, wondering whether he was\njoking, but was unable to settle the point, for Sell\u00e9n\nwas whistling.\n\n** Yes, I want a female figure,\u2019\u201d\u2019 he replied at last.\n\nThere was silence, and gradually the silence\nbecame uncomfortable : two very old acquaintances\nin a t\u00e9te-d-t\u00e9te conversation.\n\n\u201cJ wish I knew where to get a model from! I\n", "don\u2019t want the Academy models, the whole world\nknows them, and, besides, the subject is a religious\none.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want something better? I understand!\nIf it were not for the nude, I might perhaps . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cTt isn\u2019t for the nude! Are you mad? Among\nall those men . . . besides, it\u2019s a religious subject.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, we know all that. She must be dressed\nin something Oriental, and bend down as if she were\npicking up something, show her shoulders, her neck,\nand the first vertebra, I understand. Religious like\nthe Magdalene! Bird\u2019s-eye view!\u201d\n\n\u201c* You scoff and jeer at everything ! \u201d\n\n** Let\u2019s keep to the point! You shall have your\nmodel, for it\u2019s impossible to paint without one.\nYou, yourself, don\u2019t know one. Very well! Your\nreligious principles don\u2019t allow you to look for one ;\ntherefore Rehnhjelm and I, the two black sheep, will\nfind you one.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it must be a respectable girl, don\u2019t forget\nthat.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! We will see what we can do, the day\nafter to-morrow, when we shall be in funds.\u201d\u2019\n\nAnd they went on painting, quietly, diligently,\nuntil four\u2014until five. Every now and then their\nanxious glances swept the road. Sell\u00e9n was the\nfirst to break the uneasy silence.\n\n\u201cOlle is a long time! Something must have\nhappened to him,\u201d\u2019 he said.\n\n*\u201c Yes, something must be up. But why do you\nalways send the poor devil? Why can\u2019t you run\nyour own errands ? \u201d\n\n** He\u2019s nothing else to do, and he likes going.\u201d\n\n*\u201c\u201cHow d\u2019you know? And besides, let me tell\nyou, nobody can say how Olle\u2019s going to turn out.\nHe has great schemes, and he may be on his feet\nany day; then it will be a good thing to have him\nfor a friend.\u201d\n\nF\u201c* You don\u2019t say so! What great work is he going\nto accomplish ? I can quite believe that Olle will\n", "become a great man, although not a great sculptor.\nBut where the devil is he? Do you think he\u2019s\nspending the money ?\u201d\n\n\u2018** Possibly, possibly ! He\u2019s had nothing for a long\ntime and perhaps the temptation was too strong,\u201d\nanswered Lundell, tightening his belt by two holes,\nand wondering what he would do in Olle\u2019s place.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s only human, and charity begins at\nhome,\u201d said Sell\u00e9n, who knew perfectly well what\nhe would have done under the circumstances. \u2018* But\nI can\u2019t wait any longer. I must have paint, even if\nI have to steai it. Dll go and see Falk.\u201d\n\n** Are you going to squeeze more out of that poor\nchap ? You robbed him yesterday for your frame.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t a small sum you borrowed.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cMy dear fellow! I am compelled to cast all\nfeelings of shame to the winds; there\u2019s no help for\nit. One has to put up with a good deal. However,\nFalk is a great-hearted fellow who understands that\na man may suddenly find himself in Queer Street.\nAnyhow, I\u2019m going. If Olle returns in the mean-\ntime, tell him he\u2019s a blockhead. So long! Come\nto the Red Room and we'll see whether our master\nwill be graciously pleased to give us something to eat\nbefore the sun sets. Lock the door, when you leave,\nand push the key underneath the mat. By-by!\u201d\n\nHe went, and before long he stood before Falk\u2019s\ndoor in Count Magni Street. He knocked, but\nreceived no reply. He opened the door and went in.\nFaik, who had probably had uneasy dreams, awakened\nfrom his sleep, jumped up and stared at Sell\u00e9n\nwithout recognizing him.\n\n** Good evening, old chap,\u201d\u2019 said Sell\u00e9n.\n\n\u201cOh! It\u2019s you. I must have had a strange\ndream. Good evening! Sit down and smoke a\npipe! Is it evening already ? \u201d\n\nSell\u00e9n thought he knew the symptoms, but he\npretended to notice nothing.\n\n\u201cYou didn\u2019t go to the * Brass Button \u2019 to-day ?\u201d\nhe remarked,\n", "\u201cNo,\u201d replied Falk, confused; \u2018\u2018I wasn\u2019t there,\nI was at Iduna.\u201d\u2019\n\nHe really did not know whether he had dreamt it\nor whether he had actually been there; but he was\nglad that he had said it, for he was ashamed of his\nposition.\n\n\u201cPerfectly right, old chap,\u2019\u2019 commented Sell\u00e9n ;\n\u201cthe cooking at the \u2018Brass Button\u2019 is beneath\ncriticism.\u201d\n\n** It is, indeed,\u201d agreed Falk ; \u2018\u2018 the soup\u2019s damned\nbad.\u201d\n\n\u201c* And the old head-waiter is always on the spot,\ncounting the rolls and butter, the rascal !\u201d\u2019\n\nThe words \u201crolls and butter \u201d awakened Falk to\nconsciousness ; he did not feel hungry, only a little\nshaky and faint. But he did not like the subject of\nconversation and changed it.\n\n** Well, will your picture be ready for to-morrow ? \u201d\nhe asked.\n\n\u2018** No, unfortunately, it won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n** What\u2019s the matter now ? \u201d\n\n\u201c*T can\u2019t possibly finish it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYoucan\u2019t ? Why aren\u2019t you at home working ? \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cThe old, old story, my dear fellow! I have no\npaint ! No paint!\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* But there\u2019s a remedy for that! Or haven\u2019t you\nany money ?\u201d\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cTf I had I should be all right.\u201d\n\n\u201c* And [haven\u2019t any either! What\u2019s to be done ?\u201d\n\nSell\u00e9n dropped his eyes until his glanee reached the\nheight of Falk\u2019s waistcoat pocket, into which a\nheavy gold chain was creeping; not that Sell\u00e9n\nbelieved it to be gold, good, stamped gold. He\ncould not have understood the recklessness\u2019 of\ncarrying so much money outside one\u2019s waistcoat.\nBut his thoughts were following a definite course,\nand he continued :\n\n\u201cTf at least I had something to pawn! But we\ncarelessly pledged our winter overcoats on the first\nsunny day in April.\u201d\n", "Falk blushed. He had never done such a thing.\n\n** Do you pawn your winter overcoats ? \u2019\u2019 he asked.\n\u201cDo you get anything on them ? \u201d\n\n\u201cOne gets something on everything\u2014on every-\nthing,\u201d said Sell\u00e9n, laying stress on everything ; \u2018* the\nonly thing needful is to have something.\u201d\n\nTo Falk the room seemed to be turning round. He\nhad to sit down. Then he pulled out his gold watch.\n\n**How much, do you think, should I get on this\nwatch and chain ? \u201d\n\nSell\u00e9n seized the future pledges and looked at them\nwith the eye of a connoisseur.\n\n\u201cTs it gold ? \u201d he asked faintly.\n\n** Tt is gold.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c Stamped ? \u201d\n\n*\u201c* Stamped.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe chain, too ? \u201d\n\n** The chain, too.\u201d\u2019\n\n** A hundred crowns,\u201d declared Sell\u00e9n, shaking his\nhand so that the gold chain rattled. \u2018 But it\u2019s a\npity! You shouldn\u2019t pawn your things for my\nsake.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen for my own,\u201d said Falk, anxious to avoid\nthe semblance of an unselfishness which he did not\nfeel. \u201cI want money, too. If you\u2019ll turn them\ninto cash, you'll do me a service.\u201d\n\n* All right then,\u2019\u201d\u2019 said Sell\u00e9n, resolved not to\nembarrass his friend by asking indelicate questions.\n\u201cTl pawn them! Pull yourself together, old chap !\nLife is hard at times, I don\u2019t deny it; but we go\nthrough with it.\u201d\u2019\n\nHe patted Falk\u2019s shoulder with a cordiality which\ndid not often pierce the scorn with which he had\nenveloped himself.\n\nThey went out together.\n\nBy the time they had concluded the business it\nwas seven o\u2019clock. They bought the paint and\nrepaired to the Red Room.\n\nBerns\u2019 \u2018\u201c Salon\u2019 had just begun to play its\n", "civilizing part in the life of Stockholm by putting\nan end to the unhealthy caf\u00e9-chantants life which\nhad flourished\u2014or raged\u2014in the sixties, and from\nthe capital had spread over the whole country. Here,\nevery evening after seven, crowds of young people\nmet who lived in that abnormal transition stage\nwhich begins on leaving the parental roof and ends\nwith the foundation of a new home and family ;\nhere were numbers of young men who had escaped\nfrom the solitude of their room or attic to find light\nand warmth and a fellow-creature to talk to. The\nproprietor had made more than one attempt to\namuse his patrons by pantomimic, gymnastic, ballet,\nand other performances; but he had been plainly\nshown that his guests were not in search of amuse-\nment, but in quest of peace; what was wanted was\na consulting-room, where one was likely every\nmoment to chance on a friend. The band was\ntolerated because it did not stop conversation, but\nrather stimulated it, and gradually it became as\nmuch a component of the Stockholm evening diet,\nas ages and tobacco.\n\nn this way Berns\u2019 Salon became the bachelors\u2019\nclub of all Stockholm. Every circle had its special\ncorner; the colonists of Lill-Jans had usurped the\ninner chess room, usually called the Red Room on\naccount of its red furniture and for the sake of brevity.\nIt was a safe meeting-ground even if during the whole\nday the members had been scattered like chaff.\nWhen times were hard and funds had to be raised at\nany cost, regular raids were made from this spot\nround the room. A chain was formed : two members\nskirmished in the galleries, and two others attacked\nthe room lengthways. One might have said they\ndredged the room with a ground-net, and they rarely\ndredged in vain, for there was a constant flow of new\narrivals during the evening.\n\nTo-night, however, these efforts were not required ;\nSell\u00e9n, calmly and proudly, sat down on the red\nsofa in the background. After having acted a little\n", "farce on the subject of what they were going to drink,\nthey came to the conclusion that they must have some-\nthing to eat first. They were starting the \u201c sexa,\u2019\u2019 and\nFalk was beginning to feel a return of his strength,\nwhen a long shadow fell across their table. Before them\nstood Ygberg, as pale and emaciated as ever. Sell\u00e9n,\nwho was in funds to-night, and under those circum-\nstances invariably courteous and kind-hearted, pressed\nhim to have dinner with them, and Falk seconded\nthe invitation. Ygberg hesitated while examining\nthe contents of the dishes and calculating whether\nhis hunger would be satisfied or only half-satisfied.\n\n**'You wield a stinging pen, Mr. Falk,\u201d he said, in\norder to deflect the attention from the raids which\nhis fork was making on the tray.\n\n\u201cHow? What do you mean?\u201d asked Falk\nflushing ; he did not know that anybody had made\nthe acquaintance of his pen.\n\n\u2018** The article has created a sensation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat article ?. I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201c'The correspondence in the People\u2019s Flag on the\nBoard of Payment of Employ\u00e9s\u2019 Selaries,\u201d\n\n** I didn\u2019t write it.\u201d\n\n** But the Board is convinced that you did. I just\nmet a member who\u2019s a friend of mine ; he mentioned\nyou as the author; I understood that the resent-\nment was fierce.\u201d\n\n** Indeed ? \u201d\n\nFalk felt that he was half to blame for it; he\nrealized now what the notes were which Struve had\nbeen making on that evening on Moses Height. But\nStruve had merely reported what he, Falk, had said.\nHe was responsible for his statements and must\nstand by them even at the risk of being considered\na scandal-monger. Retreat was impossible; he\nrealized that he must go on.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d he said, \u2018\u201c I am the instigator of the\narticle. But let us talk of something else! What\ndo you think of Ulrica Eleonora? Isn\u2019t she an\ninteresting character ? Or what is your opinion of\n", "the Maritime Insurance Company Triton? Or\nHaquin Spegel ? \u201d :\n\n*\u201cUlrica Eleonora is the most interesting character\nin the whole history of Sweden,\u201d answered Ygberg\ngravely ; \u201cI\u2019ve just had an order to write an essay\non her.\u201d\n\n\u201c From Smith ?\u201d asked Falk.\n\n\u201cYes; but how do you know ?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve returned the block this afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to refuse work. You\u2019ll repent it!\nBelieve me.\u201d\n\nA hectic flush crimsoned Falk\u2019s cheeks ; he spoke\nfeverishly. Sell\u00e9n sat quietly on the sofa, smoking.\nHe paid more attention to the band than to the\nconversation, which did not interest him because he\ndid not understand it. From his sofa corner he\ncould see through the two open doors leading to the\nsouth gallery, and catch a glimpse of the north\ngallery. In spite of the dense cloud of smoke which\nhung above the pit between the two galleries, he\ncould distinguish the faces on the other side.\nSuddenly his attention was caught by something in\nthe distance. He clutched Falk\u2019s arm. \u00b0\n\n\u201cThe sly-boots! Look behind the left curtain ! \u201d\n\n** Lundell!\u201d\n\n** Just so! He\u2019s looking for a Magdalene! See!\nHe\u2019s talking to her now! What a beautiful girl ! \u2019\u2019\n\nFalk blushed, a fact which did not escape Sell\u00e9n.\n\n**Does he come here for his models ?\u201d he asked\nsurprised.\n\n** Well, where else should he goto? He can\u2019t find\nthem in the dark.\u201d\n\nA moment afterwards Lundell joined them;\nSell\u00e9n greeted him with a patronizing nod, the\nsignificance of which did not seem to be lost on the\nnewcomer. He bowed to Falk with more than his\nusual politeness, and expressed his astonishment at\nYgberg\u2019s presencefin disparaging words. Ygberg,\ncarefully observing him, seized the opportunity to\nask him what he would like to eat. Lundell opened\n\nF\n", "his eyes ; he seemed to have fallen among magnates.\nHe felt happy; a gentle, philanthropic mood took\npossession of him, and after ordering a hot supper,\nhe felt constrained to give expression to his emotion.\nIt was obvious that he wanted to say something to\nFalk, but it was difficult to find an opening. The\nband was playing \u2018\u2018 Hear us, Sweden ! \u201d and a moment\nafterwards \u2018\u2018 A Stronghold is our God.\u201d\n\nFalk called for more drink.\n\n**T wonder whether you admire this fine old hymn\nas much as I do, Mr. Falk ? \u2019\u2019 began Lundell.\n\nFalk, who was not conscious of admiring any one\nhymn more than another, asked him to have some\npunch. Lundell had misgivings; he did not know\nwhether he could venture. He thought he had better\nhave some more supper first; he was not strong\nenough to drink. He tried to prove it, after his\nthird liqueur, by a short but violent attack of\ncoughing.\n\n\u201cThe Torch of Reconciliation is a splendid name,\u201d\nhe said presently; \u201cit proves at the same time\nthe deep, religious need of atonement, and the\nlight which came into the world when the miracle\nhappened which has always given offence to the\nproud in spirit.\u201d\n\nHe swallowed a meat ball while carefully studying\nthe effect of his remark\u2014and felt anything but\nflattered when he saw three blank faces staring at\nhim, expressing nothing but consternation.\n\n** Spegel is a great name, and his words are not like\nthe words of the Pharisees. We all know that he\nwrote the magnificent psalm, \u2018The wailing cries\nare silent,\u2019 a psalm which has never been equalled.\nYour health, Mr. Falk! I am glad to hear that you\nare identifying yourself with the work of such a\nman.\u201d\n\nJaindell discovered that his glass was empty.\n\n\u2018\u00a9 T think IT must have another half-pint ! \u201d\u2019\n\nTwo thoughts were humming in Falk\u2019s brain:\n\u201cThe fellow is drinking neat brandy\u201d and \u2018 How\n", "did he get to know about gm ?\u201d A suspicion\nilluminated his mind like a flash of lightning, but\nhe pretended to know nothing, and merely said:\n\u201cYour health, Mr. Lundell ! \u201d\n\nThe unpleasant explanation which seemed bound\nto follow was avoided by the sudden entrance of\nOlle. It was Olle, but more rugged than before,\ndirtier than before and, to judge from his appear-\nance, lamer than before. His hips stood out beneath\nhis coat like bowsprits; a single button kept his\ncoat together close above his first rib. But he was\nin good spirits and laughed on seeing so much food\nand drink on the table. To Sell\u00e9n\u2019s horror he began\nto report on the success of his mission, all the time\ndivesting himself of his acquisitions. He had really\nbeen arrested by the police.\n\n*\u201c* Here are the tickets !\u201d\u2019\n\nHe handed Sell\u00e9n two green pawn-tickets across\nthe table, which Sell\u00e9n instantly converted into a\npaper pellet.\n\nHe had been taken to the police station. He\nhao to his coat, the collar of which was missing.\n\nhere he was asked for his name. His name was,\nof course, assumed! There existed no such name\nas Montanus! His native place? Vastmanland !\nAgaina false statement ! The inspector was a native\nof that province and knew his countrymen. His age?\nTwenty-eight years! That was a lie; he must be\nat least forty. His domicile? Lill-Jans! Another\nlie; nobody but a gardener lived there. His pro-\nfession ? Artist! That also was alie: for he looked\nlike a dock labourer.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s your paint, four tubes! Better look at\nthem carefully !\u201d\u2019\n\nHis parcel had been opened and, in the process,\none of the sheets had been torn.\n\n\u201c Therefore I only got one and twopence halfpenny\nfor both. You'll see that I\u2019m right if you'll look at\nthe ticket.\u201d\n\nThe next question was where he had stolen the\n", "things ? Olle had replied that he had not stolen\nthem; then the inspector drew his attention to the\nfact that he had not been asked whether he had stolen\nthem, but where he had stolen them? Where ?\nwhere ? where ?\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cHere\u2019s your change, twopence halfpenny; Dve\nkept nothing back.\u201d\n\nThen the evidence was taken down and the stolen\ngoods\u2014which had been sealed with three seals\u2014\nwere described. In vain had Olle protested, in vain\nhad he appealed to their sense of justice and humanity ;\nthe only result of his protestations was a suggestion\nmade by the constable to place on record that the\nprisoner\u2014he was already regarded in the light of a\nprisoner\u2014was heavily intoxicated; the suggestion\nwas acted upon, but the word heavily was omitted.\nAfter the inspector had repeatedly urged the constable\nto try and remember whether the prisoner had offered\nresistance at his arrest, and the constable had declared\nthat he could not take his oath on it\u2014it would have\nbeen a very serious matter for the prisoner looked a\ndesperate character\u2014but it had appeared to him that\nhe had tried to resist by taking refuge in a doorway\nthe latter statement was placed on record.\n\nThen a report was drawn up, and Olle was ordered\nto sign it. It ran as follows :\n\nA male individual of sinister and forbidding\nappearance was found slinking along the row of houses\nin Northland Street, carrying a suspicious-looking\nparcel in his hand. On his arrest he was dressed in\na green frock-coat\u2014he wore no waistcoat\u2014blue serge\ntrousers, a shirt with the initials P.L. (which clearly\n\nroves that cither the shirt was stolen or that he\nfend given a wrong name), woollen stockings with\ngrey edges, and a felt hat with a cock\u2019s feather.\nPrisoner gave the assumed name of Olle Montanus,\nfalsely deposed that his people were peasants in\nViistmanland and that he was an artist, domiciled\nat Lill-Jans, obviously an invention. Onjbeing\narrested he tried to offer resistance by taking refuge\n", "in a doorway. \u2018Then followed a minute description\nof the contents of the parcel.\n\nAs Olle refused to admit the correctness of this\nreport, a telegram was sent to the prison, and a\nconveyance appeared to fetch Olle, the bundle, and\na constable.\n\nAs they were turning into Mint Street, Olle caught\nsight of Per Illson, a member of Parliament and a\ncountryman of his. He called to him, and Per\nIllson proved that the report was wrong. Olle was\nreleased and his bundle was restored to him. And\nnow he had come to join them and\u2014\u2014\n\n\u201cHere are your French rolls! There are only five\nof them, for I\u2019ve eaten one. And here\u2019s the beer !\u201d\n\nHe produced five French rolls from his coat pockets,\nlaid dn on the table, and placed two bottles of\nbeer, which he pulled out of his trousers pockets, by\nthe side of them, after which his figure resumed its\nusual disproportions.\n\n** Falk, old chap, you must excuse Olle; he\u2019s not\nused to smart society. Put the French rolls back\ninto your pockets, Olle! What will you be up to\nnext ?\u201d\u2019 said Sell\u00e9n disapprovingly.\n\nOlle obeyed.\n\nLundell refused to have the tray taken away,\nalthough he had cleared the dishes so thoroughly\nthat it would have been impossible to say what they\nhad contained ; every now and then he seized the\nbrandy bottle, absent-mindedly, and poured himself\nout half a glass. Occasionally he stood up or turned\nround in his chair to \u201c\u2018 see what the band was playing.\u201d\nOn those occasions Sell\u00e9n kept a close eye on him.\n\nAt last Rehnhjelm arrived. He had obviously\nbeen drinking ; he sat down silently, his eyes seeking\nan object on which they could rest while he listened\nto Lundell\u2019s exhortations. Finally his weary eyes\nfell on Sell\u00e9n and remained riveted on the velvet\n\nwaistcoat, which gave him plenty of food for thought\nfor the remainder of the evening. His face brightened\nmomentarily as if he had met an old friend ; but the\n", "light on it went out as Sell\u00e9n buttoned up his coat\n*\u2018 because there was a draught.\u201d\n\nYgberg took care that Olle had some supper, and\nnever tired of urging him to help himself and to fill\nhis glass.\n\nAs the evening advanced music and conversation\ngrew more and more lively.\n\nThis state of semi-stupor had a great charm for\nFalk ; it was warm, light, and noisy here; he was\nin the company of men whose lives he had prolonged\nfor a few more hours and who were therefore gay and\nlively, as flies revived by the rays of the sun. He\nfelt that he was one of them, for he knew that in\ntheir inner consciousness they were unhappy; they\nwere unassuming ; they understood him, and they\ntalked like human beings and not like books; even\ntheir coarseness was not unattractive; there was so\nmuch naturalness in it, so much innocence; even\nLundell\u2019s hypocrisy did not repulse him; it was so\nnaive and sat on him so loosely, that it could have\nbeen cast off at any moment.\n\nAnd the evening passed away and the day was\nover which had pushed Falk irrevocably on to the\nthorny path of the writer.\n", "CHAPTER VII\nTHE IMITATION OF CHRIST\nOn the following morning Falk was awakened by a\nmaid servant who brought him a letter. He opened\nit and read :\nTimothy x. 27, 28, 29.\nFirst Corinth. vi. 3, 4, 5.\n\nDear BRoruEr,\n\nThe grace and peace of our Lord J. C., the\nlove of the father and the fellowship of the H. G.,\nete., Amen.\n\nI read last night in the Grey Bonnet that you are\ngoing to edit the Torch of Reconciliation. Meet me\nin my office to-morrow morning.\n\nYour saved brother,\nNATHANAEL SKORE.\n\nNow he partially understood Lundell\u2019s riddle.\nHe did not know Skore, the great champion of the\nLord, personally; he knew nothing of the Torch\nof Reconciliation, but he was curious and decided to\nobey the insolent request.\n\nAt nine o\u2019clock he was in Government Street,\nlooking at the imposing four-storied house, the front\nof which, from cellar to roof, was covered by sign-\nboards: \u2018\u2018 Christian Printing office, Peace, Ltd.,\nsecond floor. Editorial office, The Inheritance of\nthe Children of God, half-landing floor. Publishing\noffice, The Last weg ibe first floor. Publishing\noffice, The Trump of Peace, second floor. Editorial\noffice of the children\u2019s paper, Feed My Lambs, first\n\n87\n", "floor. Offices of the Christian Prayer House Society,\nLtd., The Seat of Mercy. Loans granted against\nfirst securities, third floor. Come to Jesus, third\nfloor. Employment found for respectable salesmen\nwho can offer security. Foreign Missions Society,\nLtd., Eagle, distribution of the profits of the year\n1867 in coupons, second floor. Offices of the\nChristian Mission Steamer Zululu, second floor.\nThe steamer will leave, D.V., on the 28th. Goods\nreceived against bill of lading and certificate at the\nshipping offices close to the landing-bridge where the\nsteamer is loading. Needlework society \u2018 Ant Heap \u2019\nreceives gifts, first floor. Clergymen\u2019s bands washed\nand ironed by the porter. Wafers at 1s. 6d. a pound\nobtainable from the porter. Black dress-coats for\nconfirmation candidates let out. Unfermented wine\n(Mat. xix. 32) at 94d. per quart; apply to the\nporter. (Bring your own jug.)\u201d\n\nOn the ground floor, to the left of the archway,\nwas a Christian bookshop. Falk stopped for a few\nmoments and read the titles of the books exhibited\nin the window. It was the usual thing. Indiscreet\nquestions, impudent charges, offensive familiarities.\nBut his attention was mainly attracted to a number\nof illustrated magazines with large English woodcuts,\ndisplayed in the window in order to attract the passers-\nby. More especially the children\u2019s papers had an\ninteresting table of contents, and the young man in\nthe shop could have told anyone who cared to know\nthat old men and women would pass hours before\nthis window, lost in contemplation of the illustra-\ntions, which appeared to move their pious hearts\nand awaken memories of their vanished\u2014and perhaps\nwasted\u2014youth.\n\nHe climbed the broad stairease between Pompeian\nfrescoes reminiscent of the path which does not lead\nto salvation, and came to a large room furnished with\ndesks like a bank, but so far unoceupied by cashiers\nand book-keepers. In the centre of the room stood\na writing-table, of the size of an altar, resembling an\n", "organ with many stops; there was a complete key-\nboard with buttons and semaphores with trumpct-\nlike speaking-tubes, connected with all parts of the\nbuilding. A big man in riding-boots was standing\nat the writing-desk. He wore a cassock fastened with\none button at the neck which gave it a military\nappearance ; the coat was surmounted by a white\nband and the mask of a sea captain, for the real face\nhad long ago been mislaid in one of the desks or\nboxes. The big man was slapping the tops of his\nboots with his horsewhip, the handle of which was\nin the form of a symbolical hoof, and sedulously\nsmoking and chewing a strong regalia, probably to\nkeep his jaws.in trim. Falk looked at the big man\nin astonishment.\n_ This, then, was the last fashion in clergymen, for\nin men, too, there is a fashion. This was the great\npromulgator, who had succeeded in making it fashion-\nable to be sinful, to thirst for mercy, to be poor and\nwretched, in fact, to be a worthless specimen of\nhumanity in every possible way. This was the man\nwho had brought salvation in vogue! He had\ndiscovered a gospel for smart society. The divine\nordinance of grace had become a sport! There were\ncompetitions in viciousness in which the prize was\ngiven to the sinner. Paper chases were arranged to\neatch poor souls for the purpose of saving them ;\nbut also, let us confess it, battues for subjects on\nwhom to demonstrate one\u2019s conversion in a practical\nmanner, by venting on them the most cruel charity.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you, Mr. Falk,\u201d said the mask.\n\u201c\u201c Welcome, dear friend! Perhaps you would like to\nsee something of my work ? Pardon me, I hope you\nare saved? Yes, this is the office of the printing\nworks. Excuse me a second.\u201d\n\nHe stepped up to the organ and pulled out several\nstops. The answer was a long whistle.\n\n* Just have a look round.\u201d\n\nHe put his mouth to one of the trumpets and\nshouted; \u2018The seventh trumpet and the eighth woe !\n", "Composition Medizval 8, titles Gothic, names spaced\nout.\u201d\n\nA voice answered through the same trumpet:\n\u2018* No more manuscript.\u201d\u201d The mask sat down at the\norgan, and took a pen and a sheet of foolseap. The\npen raced over the paper while he talked, cigar in\nmouth.\n\n\u201cThis activity\u2014is so extensive\u2014that it would\nsoon\u2014be beyond my strength\u2014and my _ health\u2014\nwould be worse\u2014than it is\u2014if I did\u2014not look after\nit\u2014so well.\u201d\n\nHe jumped up, pulled out another stop and\nshouted into another trumpet: \u201c Proofs of \u2018 Have\nyou paid your Debt ?\u2019\u201d\u2019 Then he continued writing\nand talking.\n\n\u201cYou wonder\u2014why\u2014I\u2014wear riding-boots. It\u2019s\nfirst\u2014because\u2014I take riding exercises\u2014for the sake\nof\u2014my health. .. .\u201d\n\nA boy appeared with proofs. The mask handed\nthem to F ake ** Please read that,\u201d he said, speaking\nthrough his nose, because his mouth was busy, while\nhis eyes shouted to the boy: Wait !\n\n\u201c. . . secondly\u2014(a movement of the ears plainly\nconveyed to Falk that he had not lost the thread),\nbecause\u2014I am of opinion\u2014that a spiritually minded\nman should not\u2014be conspicuous\u2014by his appearance\n\u2014for this would be\u2014spiritual pride\u2014and a challenge\n\u2014to the scoffers.\u201d\n\nA book-keeper entered. The mask acknowledged\nhis salutation by a wrinkling of his forehead, the\nonly part of his face which was unoccupied.\n\nFor want of something else to do, Falk took the\nproofs and began to read them. \u2018The cigar continued\ntalking :\n\n\u2018\u201c* Everybody\u2014wears\u2014riding-boots. I won\u2019t\u2014be\nconspicuous\u2014by my\u2014appearance. I wear\u2014riding-\nboots\u2014because\u2014I\u2019m no humbug.\u201d\n\nHe handed the manuscript to the boy and shouted\n\u2014with his lips: \u2018\u2018 Four sticks\u2014Seventh trumpet for\nNystr\u00e9m ! \u201d\u2019\u2014and then to Falk :\n", "**T shall be disengaged in five minutes. Will you\ncome with me to the warehouse ? \u201d\n\nAnd to the book-keeper :\n\n* Zululu is charging ? \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cBrandy,\u201d answered the book-keeper in a rusty\nvoice.\n\n** Everything all right ? \u201d\n\n** Everything all right.\u201d\n\n** In God\u2019s name, then! Come along Mr. Falk.\u201d\n\nThey entered a room the walls of which were lined\nwith shelves, filled with piles of books. The mask\ntouched them with his horsewhip and said proudly :\n\n** T\u2019ve written those! What do you think of that ?\nIsn\u2019t it a lot? You, too, write\u2014a little. If you\nstick to it, you might write as much.\u201d\n\nHe bit and tore at his cigar and spat out the tiny\nflakes which filled the air like flies and settled on the\nbacks of the books. His face wore a look of con-\ntempt.\n\n\u201cThe Torch of Reconciliation! Hm! I think it\u2019s\na stupid name! Don\u2019t you rather agree with me ?\nWhat made you think of it ?\u201d\n\nFor the first time Falk had a chance of getting in a\nword, for like all great men, the mask answered his\nown questions. His reply was in the negative but\nhe got no further; the mask again usurped the\nconversation.\n\n\u201cTI think it\u2019s a very stupid name. And do you\nreally believe that it will draw ? \u201d\n\n\u201cIT know nothing whatever about the matter; I\ndon\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know ?\u201d\u2019\n\nHe took up a paper and pointed to a paragraph.\n\nFalk, very much taken aback, read the following\nadvertisement :\n\n\u201cNotice to subscribers: The Torch of Reconcilia-\ntion. Magazine for Christian readers, about to\nappear under the editorship of Arvid Falk whose\nwork has been awarded a prize by the Academy of\nSciences. The first number will contain \u2018 God\u2019s\n", "Creation,\u2019 by Hokan Spegel, a poem of an admittedly\nreligious and npsouniley Christian spirit.\u201d\n\nFalk had forgotten Spegel and his agreement ; he\nstood speechless.\n\n\u201c\u201c How large is the edition going to be 2? What ?\nTwo thousand, I suppose. Too small!

You know, that Pin very\npopular ; I can\u2019t help that\u2014it is so! I should be a\nhypocrite if I pretended not to know what all the\nworld knows! Well, I\u2019ll give you a helping hand to\nbegin with. Look at this bag here! If I say that\nit contains letters from persons\u2014ladies\u2014don\u2019t upset\nyourself, I\u2019m a married man\u2014begging for my\nportrait, I have not said too much.\u201d\n\nAs a matter of fact it was nothing but an ordinary\nbag which he touched with his whip.\n\n\u201cTo save them and me a great deal of trouble,\nand at the same time for the sake of doing a fellow-\nman a kindness, I have decided to permit you to\nwrite my biography ; then you can safely issue ten\nthousand copies of your first number and pocket a\nclear thousand.\u201d\n\n** But, my dear pastor\u2014he had it on the tip of his\ntonguc to say captain\u2014I know nothing at all about\nthis matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind! Never mind! The publisher has\nhimself written to me and asked me for my portrait.\nAnd you are to write my biography! To facilitate\nyour work, I asked a friend to write down the principal\npoints. You have only to write an introduction,\n\nbricf and eloquent\u2014a few sticks at the most. That\u2019s\nall.\u201d\n", "So much foresight depressed Falk; he was sur-\nprised to find the portrait so unlike the original, and\nthe friend\u2019s handwriting so much like that of the\nmask.\n\nThe\u2019 latter, who hed given him portrait and\nmanuscript, now held out his hand expecting to be\nthanked.\n\n** My regards to\u2014the publisher.\u201d\n\nHe had so nearly said Smith, that a slight blush\nappeared between his whiskers.\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t know my views yet,\u2019\u2019 protested\nFalk.\n\n\u201cViews ? Have I asked what your views are ?\nT never ask anybody about his views. God forbid !\nI? Never!\u201d\n\nOnce more he touched the backs of his publications\nwith his whip, opened the door, let the biogranher\nout and returned to his service at the altar.\n\nFalk, as usual, could not think of a suitable answer\nuntil it was too late; when he thought of one, he\nwas already in the street. A cellar window which\nhappened to stand wide open (and was not covered\nwith advertisements) received biography and portrait\ninto safe keeping.\n\nThen Falk went to the nearest newspaper office,\nhanded in a protest against the Torch of Reconcilia-\ntion, and resigned himself to starve.\n", "CHAPTER VIII\nPOOR MOTHER COUNTRY\nTne clock on the Riddarholms Church struck ten\nas Falk arrived, a few days later, at the Parliamentary\nbuildings to assist the representative of the Red Cap\nin reporting the proceedings of the Second Chamber.\n\nHe hastened his footsteps, convinced that here,\nwhere the pay was good, strict punctuality would\nbe looked upon as a matter of course. He climbed\nthe Committee stairs and was shown to the reporters\u2019\ngallery on the left. A feeling of awe overcame him\nas he walked across the few boards, hung up under the\nroof like a pigeon house, where the men of \u201c free\nspeech listen to the discussion of the country\u2019s most\nsacred interests by the country\u2019s most worthy\nrepresentatives.\u201d\n\nIt was a new sensation to Falk; but he was far\nfrom being impressed as he looked down from his\nseaffolding into the empty hall which resembled a\nLaneastrian schoo]. It was five minutes past ten, but\nwith the exception of himself, not a soul was present.\nAll of a sudden the silence was broken by a scraping\nnoise. A rat! he thought, but almost immediately\nhe discovered, on the opposite gallery, across the\nhuge, empty hall, a short, abject figure sharpening\na pencil on the rail. He watched the chips fluttering\ndown and settling on the tables below.\n\nHis eyes scanned the empty walls without finding\na resting-place, until finally they fell on the old\nclock, dating from the time of Napoleon I, with its\nimperial newly lit emblems, symbolical of the old\nstory, and its hands, now pointing to ten minutes\n\n94\n", "past ten, symbolical] in the spirit of irony\u2014of some-\nthing else. At the same moment the doors in the\nbackground opened and a man entered. He was old ;\nhis shoulders stooped under the burden of public\noffices; his back had shrunk under the weight of\ncommunal commissions; the long continuance in\ndamp offices, committee-rooms and safe deposits\nhad warped his neck ; there was a suggestion of the\npensioner in his calm foosteps, as he walked up the\ncocoanut matting towards the chair. When he\nhad reached the middle of the long passage and had\ncome into line with the imperial clock, he stopped ;\nhe seemed accustomed to stopping half-way and\nlooking round and backwards ; but now he \u2014\nto compare his watch with the clock; he shook his\nold, worn out head with a look of discontent: \u201c* Fast!\nFast!\u201d he murmured. His features expressed a\nsupernatural calm and the assurance that his watch\ncould not be slow. He continued his way with\nthe same deliberate footsteps ; he might be walking\ntowards the goal of his life; and it was very much\na question whether he had not attained it when he\narrived at the venerable chair on the platform.\nWhen he was standing close by it he pulled out his\nhandkerchief and blew his nose; his eyes roamed\nover the brilliant audience of chairs and tables,\nannouncing an important event: \u2018Gentlemen, I\nhave blown my nose.\u201d Then he sat down and sank\ninto a presidential calm which might have been sleep,\nif it had not been waking; and, alone in the large\nroom, as he imagined, alone with his God, he prepared\nto summon strength for the business of the day,\nwhen a loud scraping on the left, high up, under-\nneath the roof, pierced the stillness ; he started and\nturned his head to kill with a three-quarter look the\ntat which dared to gnaw in his presence. Falk\nwho had omitted to take into account the resonant\ncapacity of the pigeon house, received the deadly\nthrust of the murderous glance; but the glance\nsoftened as it slid down from the caves-mouldings,\n", "whispering\u2014* Only a reporter ; I was afraid it might\nbe a rat.\u2019\u201d\u2019 And deep regret stole over the murderer,\ncontrition at the sin committed by his eye; he\nburied his face in his hands and\u2014wept ? Oh, no!\nhe rubbed olf the spot which the appearance of a\nrepulsive object had thrown on his retina.\n\nPresently the doors were flung wide open; the\ndelegates were beginning to arrive, while the hands\non the clock erept forward\u2014forward. \u2018The president\nrewarded the good with friendly nods and pressures\nof the hand, and punished the evil-doers by turning\naway his head; he was bound to be just as the\nMost High.\n\nThe reporter of the Red Cap arrived, an un-\nprepossceina individual, not quite sober and only\nhalf awake. In spite of this he seemed to find\npleasure in answering truthfully the questions put\nby the newcomer.\n\nOnce more the doors were flung open and in stalked\na man with as much self-assurance as if he were in\nhis own home: he was the treasurer of the Inland\nRevenue Office and actuary of the Board of Payment\nof Employ\u00e9s\u2019 Salaries; he approached the chair,\ngrected the president like an old acquaintance and\nbegan to rummage in the papers as if they were his\nown.\n\n*\u201c Who\u2019s this ?\u201d\u2019 asked Falk.\n\n\u201cIhe chief clerk,\u2019 answered his friend from the\nRed Cap.\n\n\u201cWhat ? Do they write here, too, then ?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo ? You'll soon sec! They keep a story full\nof clerks; the attics are full of clerks and they\u2019ll\nsoon have clerks in the cellars.\u201d\n\nThe room below was now presenting the aspect of\nan ant-heap. A rap of the hammer and there was\nsilence. The head clerk read the minutes of the\nlast meeting, and they were signed without comment.\nThen the same man read a petition for a fortnight\u2019s\nleave, sent in by Jon Jonson from Lerbak. It was\ngranted.\n", "\u201cDo they have holidays here ?\u201d asked the novice,\nsurprised.\n\n\u201cCertainly, Jon Jonson wants to go home and\nplant his potatoes.\u201d\n\nThe platform down below was now beginning to\nfill with young men armed with pen and_ paper.\nAll of them were old acquaintances from the time\nwhen Falk was a Government official. They took\ntheir seats at little tables as if they were going to\nplay \u2018\u2018 Preference.\u201d\n\n*\u201cThose are the clerks,\u2019 explained the Red Cap ;\n\u201cthey appear to recognize you.\u201d\n\nAnd they really did; they put on their eye-glasses\nand stared at the pigeon house with the condescension\nvouchsafed in a theatre by the occupants of the\nstalls to the occupants of the galleries. They\nwhispered among themselves, evidently discussing\nan absent acquaintance who, from unmistakable\nevidence, must have been sitting on the chair occupied\nby Falk. The latter was so deeply touched ad the\ngeneral interest that he looked with anything but a\nfriendly eye on Struve, who was entering the pigeon\nhouse, reserved, unembarrassed, dirty and a con-\nservative.\n\nThe chief clerk read a petition, or a resolution,\nto grant the necessary money for the provision of\nnew door mats and new brass numbers on the lockers\ndestined for the reception of overshoes.\n\nGranted !\n\n\u2018Where is the opposition ?\u201d\u2019 asked the tyro.\n\n\u201cThe devil knows ! \u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c But they say Yes to everything !\u201d\n\n\u201c Wait a little and you'll see!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cHaven\u2019t they come yet ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere every one comes and goes as he pleases.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is the Government Offices all over\nagain !\u201d\u2019\n\nThe conservative Struve, who had heard the\nfrivolous words, thought it incumbent on him to take\nup the cudgels for the Government.\n\nG\n", "\u2018* What is this, little Falk is saying?\u201d he asked.\n\u201cHe mustn\u2019t growl here.\u201d\n\nIt took Falk so long to find a suitable reply that\nthe discussions down below had started in the mean-\ntime.\n\n*\u201c Don\u2019t mind him,\u201d said the Red Cap, soothingly ;\n\u201che\u2019s invariably a conservative when he has the\nprice of a dinner in his pocket, and he\u2019s just borrowed\na fiver from me.\u201d\n\nThe chief clerk was reading : 54. Report of the Com-\nmittee on Ola Hipsson\u2019s motion to remove the fences.\n\nTimber merchant Larsson from Norrland demanded\nacceptance as it stood. \u2018\u2018 What is to become of our\nforests ?\u201d\u2019 he burst out. \u2018\u2018 I ask you, what is to be-\ncome of our forests?\u201d And he threw himself on\nhis bench, puffing.\n\nThis racy eloquence had gone out of fashion\nduring the last few years, and the words were received\nwith hisses, after which the puffing on the Norrland\nbench ceased.\n\nThe representative for Ocland suggested sand-\nstone walls ; Scania\u2019s delegate preferred box; Nor-\nbotten\u2019s opined that fences were unnecessary where\nthere were no fields, and a member on the Stockholm\nbench proposed that the matter should be referred\ntoa Committee of experts : he laid stress on \u201c\u2018 experts.\u201d\nA violent seene followed. Death rather than a com-\nmittee! The question was put to the vote. The\nmotion was rejected; the fences would remain\nstanding until they decayed.\n\nThe chief clerk was reading: 66. Report of the\nCommittee on Carl J\u00e9nsson\u2019s proposition to intereept\nthe moneys for the Bible Commission. At the sound\nof the venerable name of an institution a hundred\nyears old, even the smiles died away and a respectful\nsilence ensued. Who would dare to attack religion\nin its very foundation, who would dare to face\nuniversal contempt ? The Bishop of Ystad asked\npermission to speak.\n\n\u201cShall I write ?\u201d\u2019 asked Falk.\n", "\u201cNo, what he says doesn\u2019t concern us.\u201d\n\nBut the conservative Struve took down the\nfollowing notes: Sacred. Int. Mother country.\nUnited names religion humanity 829, 1632. Un-\nbelief.. Mania for innovations. God\u2019s word. Man\u2019s\nword. Centen. Ansgar. Zeal. Honesty. Fairplay.\nCapac. Doctrine.

They\nwould not hear.\n\nCar! J\u00e9nsson held the floor.\n\n\u201c* Now it\u2019s our turn!\u201d said the Red Cap.\n\nAnd they wrote while Struve embroidered the\nBishop\u2019s velvet.\n\nTwaddle. Big words. Commission sat for a hundred\nyears. Costs 100.000 Crowns. 9 archbishops. 30\nProf. Upsala. Together 500 years. Dietaries.\nSecretaries. Amanuenses. Done nothing. Proof sheet.\nBad work. Money money money. Everything by its\nright name. Humbug. Official sucking-system.\n\nNo one else spoke but when the question was put\nto the vote, the motion was accepted.\n\nWhile the Red Cap with practised hand smoothed\nJ\u00e9nsson\u2019s stumbling speech, and provided it with\na strong title, Falk took a rest. Accidentally\nscanning the strangers\u2019 gallery, his gaze fell on a\nwell-known head, resting on the rail and belonging\nto Olle Montanus. At the moment he had the\nappearance of a dog, carefully watching a bone;\nand he was not there without a very definite reason,\nbut Falk was in the dark. Olle was very secretive.\n\nFrom the end of the bench, just below the right\ngallery, on the very spot where the abject individual\u2019s\npencil chips had fluttered down, a man now arose.\nHe wore a blue uniform, had a three-cornered hat\nai, under his arm and held a roll of paper in his\n\nd.\n\nThe hammer fell and an ironical, malicious silence\nfollowed.\n", "\u2018\u201c\u201cWrite,\u201d\u2019 said the Red Cap; \u2018 take down the\nfigures, I'll do the rest.\u201d\u2019\n\nWho is.it ?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c\u201c'These are Royal propositions.\u201d\n\nThe man in blue was reading from the paper roll :\n\u2018\u2018H.M. most gracious proposition; to increase the\nfunds of the department assisting young men of birth\nin the study of foreign languages, under the heading\nof stationery and sundry expenses, from 50.000\ncrowns to 56.000 crowns 87 6\u00e9re.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are sundry expenses ?\u201d\u2019 asked Falk.\n\n\u201cWater bottles, umbrella stands,  spittoons,\nVenetian blinds, dinners, tips and so on. Be quiet,\nthere\u2019s more to come !\u201d\n\nThe paper roll went on: \u2018H.M. most gracious\nproposition to ereate sixty new commissions in the\nWest-Gotic cavalry.\u201d\n\n*\u201cDid he say sixty?\u201d asked Falk, who was\nunfamiliar with public affairs.\n\n\u2018** Sixty, yes; write it down.\u201d\n\nThe paper roll opened out and grew bigger and\nbigger. \u2018*H.M. most gracious proposition to create\nfive new regular clerkships in the Board of Payment\nof Employ\u00e9s\u2019 Salaries.\n\nGreat excitement at the Preference tables; great\nexcitement on Falk\u2019s chair.\n\nNow the paper roll rolled itself up; the chairman\nrose and thanked the reader with a bow which plainly\nsaid: \u2018\u2018Is there nothing else we can do?\u201d The\nowner of the paper roll sat down on the bench and\nblew away the chips the man above him had allowed\nto falldown. His stiff, embroidered collar prevented\nhim from committing the same offence which the\npresident had perpetrated earlier in the morning.\n\nThe proceedings continued. The peasant Sven\nSvensson asked for permission to say a few words\non the Poor Law. With one accord all the reporters\narose, yawned and stretched themselves.\n\n\u201cWe'll go to lunch now,\u201d explained the Red\nCap. \u2018\u2018 We have an hour and ten minutes.\u201d\n", "But Sven Svensson was speaking.\n\nThe delegates began to get up from their places ;\ntwo or three of them went out. The president spoke\nto some of the good members and by doing so ex-\npressed in the name of the Government his disapproval\nof all Sven Svensson might be going to say. Two\nolder members pointed him out to a newcomer as\nif he were a strange beast; they watched him for\na few moments, found him ridiculous and turned\ntheir backs on him.\n\nThe Red Cap was under the impression that\npoliteness required him to explain that the speaker\nwas the \u201cscourge\u201d of the Chamber. He was\nneither hot nor cold, could be used by no party,\nbe won for no interests, but he spoke\u2014spoke. What\nhe spoke about no one could tell, for no paper re-\nported him, and nobody took the trouble to look up\nthe records; but the clerks at the tables had-sworn\nthat if they ever came into power, they would amend\nthe laws for his sake.\n\nFalk, however, who had a certain weakness for all\nthose who were overlooked remained behind and\nheard what he had not heard for many a day: a\nman of honour, who lived an irreproachable life,\nespousing the cause of the oppressed and the down-\ntrodden while nobody Kitened to him.\n\nStruve, at the sight of the peasant, had taken his\nown departure, and had gone to a restaurant; he\nwas quickly followed by all the reporters and half\nthe deputies.\n\nAfter luncheon they returned and sat down on the\nnarrow stairs; for a little longer they heard Sven\nSvensson speaking, or rather, saw him speaking,\nfor now the conversation had become so lively that\nnot a single word of the speech could be understood. _,\n\nBut the speaker was bound to come to an end; \u00a5\nnobody had any objections to make; his speech\nhad no result whatever; it was exactly as if it\nhad never been made.\n\nThe chief clerk, who during this interval had had\n", "time to go to his offices, look at the official papers,\nand poke his fires, was again in his place, reihug':\n\u201c72. Memorial of the Royal Commission on Per\nIlsson\u2019s motion to grant ten thousand crowns for\nthe restoration of the old sculptures in the church of\nTriaskola.\u201d\u2019\n\nThe dog\u2019s head on the rail of the strangers\u2019 gallery\nassumed a threatening aspect; he looked as if\nhe were going to fight for his bone.\n\n** Do you know the freak up there in the gallery ? \u201d\u2019\nasked the Red Cap.\n\n** Olle Montanus, yes, I know him.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know that he and the church of Triaskola\nare countrymen? He\u2019s a shrewd fellow! Look\nat the expression on his face now that Traskola\u2019s turn\nhas come.\u201d\n\nPer Ilsson was speaking.\n\nStruve contemptuously turned his back on the\nspeaker and cut himself a piece of tobacco. But\nFalk and the Red Cap trimmed their pencils for\naction.\n\n\u201cYou take the flourishes, I'll take the facts,\u201d\nsaid the Red Cap.\n\nAfter the lapse of a quarter of an hour Falk\u2019s\npaper was covered with the following notes.\n\nNative Culture. Social Interests. Charge of\nmaterialism. Accord. Fichte material, Native Culture\nnot mater. Ergo charge rejected. Venerable temple.\nIn the radiance morning sun pointing heavenwards.\nFrom heath. times Philos. never dreamt. Sacred\nrights. Nation. Sacred Int. Native Cult. Literature.\nAcademy. History. Antiquity.\n\nThe speech which had repeatedly called forth\nuniversal amusement especially at the exhumation\nof the deceased Fichte, provoked replies from the\nMetropolitan Bench and the bench of Upsala.\n\nThe delegate on the Metropolitan bench said that\nalthough he knew neither the church of Traskola nor\nFichte and doubted whether the old plaster-boys\nwere worth ten thousand crowns, yet he thought\n", "himself justified in urging the Chamber to encourage\nthis beautiful undertaking as it was the first time\nthe majority had asked for money for a purpose\nother than the building of bridges, fences, national\nschools, ete.\n\nThe delegate on the bench of Upsala held\u2014\naccording to Struve\u2019s notes\u2014that the mover of the\nproposition was @ priori right; that his premise, /\nthat native culture should be encouraged, was\ncorrect; that the conclusion that ten thousand\ncrowns should be voted was binding; that the\npurpose, the aim, the tendency, was_ beautiful,\n\nraiseworthy, patriotic; but an error had certainly\n60m committed. By whom? By the Mother\ncountry ? The State? The church? No! By the\nproponent ? The proponent was right according\nto common sense, and therefore the speaker\u2014he\nbegged the Chamber to pardon the repetition\u2014could\nas praise the = the aim, the tendency. The\nproposition had its warmest sympathies; he was\ncalling on the Chamber in the name of the Mother\ncountry, in the name of art and civilization, to vote\nfor it. But he himself felt bound to vote against it,\nbecause he was of the opinion that, conformable to\nthe idea, it was erroneous, motiveless and figurative,\nas it subsumed the conception of the place under that\nof the State.\n\nThe head in the strangers\u2019 gallery rolled its eyes\nand moved its lips convulsively while the motion\nwas put to the vote; but when the proceeding was\nover and the proposition had been accepted, the\nhead disappeared in the discontented and jostling\naudience.\n\nFalk did not fail to understand the connexion\nbetween Per Ilsson\u2019s proposition and Olle\u2019s presence\nand disappearance. Struve, who had become even\n\nmore loud and conservative after lunch, talked\nunreservedly of many things. The Red Cap was\ncalm and indifferent ; he had ceased to be astonished\nat anything.\n", "From the dark cloud of humanity which had been\nrent by Olle\u2019s exit, suddenly broke a face, clear,\nbright and radiant as the sun, and Arvid Falk, whose\nglanees had strayed to the gallery, felt compelled\nto east down his eyes and turn away his head\u2014he\nhad recognized his brother, the head of the family,\nthe pride of the name, which he intended to make\ngreat and honourable. Behind Nicholas Falk\u2019s\nshoulder half of a black face could be seen, gentle\nand deceitful, which seemed to whisper secrets into\nthe ear of the fair man. Falk had only time to be\nsurprised at his brother\u2019s presence\u2014he knew his\nresentment at the new form of administration\u2014\nfor the president had given Anders Andersson per-\nmission to state a proposition. Andersson availed\nhimself of the permission with the greatest calm.\n\u201cIn view of certain events,\u2019\u2019 he read, \u2018\u2018 move that\na Bill should be passed making his Majesty jointly\nand _ severally liable for all joint-stock companies\nwhose statutes he has sanctioned.\u201d\u2019\n\nThe sun on the strangers\u2019 gallery lost its brilliancy\nand a storm burst out in the Chamber.\n\nLike a flash Count Splint was on his legs :\n\n\u2018 Quosque tandem, Catilina! It has come to that!\nMembers are forgetting themselves so far as to\ndare to criticize Government! Yes, gentlemen,\ncriticize Government, or, what is even worse, make\na joke of it; for this motion cannot be anything but\na vulgar joke. Did I say joke? It is treason!\nOh! My poor country! Your unworthy sons have\nforgotten the debt they owe you! But what else\ncan we expect, now, that you have lost your knightly\nguard, your shield and your arms! I request the\nblackguard Per Andersson, or whatever his name may\nbe, to withdraw his motion or, by Gad! he shall see\nthat King and country still have loyal servants,\nable to pick up a stone and fling it at the head of the\nmany-headed hydra of treason.\u201d\n\nApplause from the strangers\u2019 gallery ; indignation\nin the Chamber.\n", "\u201cHa! Do you think I\u2019m afraid ?\u201d\n\nThe speaker made a gesture as if he were throwing\na stone, but on every one of the hydra\u2019s hundred\nfaces lay a smile. Glaring round, in search of a\nhydra .which did not smile, the speaker discovered\nit in the reporters\u2019 gallery.\n\nThere! There!\u2019\n\nHe pointed to the pigeon house and in his eyes\nlay an expression as if he saw all hell open.\n\n\u201c\u201c'That\u2019s the crows\u2019 nest! I hear their croaking,\nbut it doesn\u2019t frighten me! Arise, men of Sweden !\nCut off the tree, saw through the boards, pull down\nthe beams, kick the chairs to pieces, break the desks\ninto fragments, small as my little finger\u2014he held\nit up\u2014and then burn the blackguards until nothing\nof them is left. Then the kingdom will flourish in\npeace and its institutions will thrive. Thus speaks\na Swedish nobleman! Peasants, remember. his\nwords ! \u201d\n\nThis speech which three years ago would have\nbeen Welcomed with acclamations, taken down\nverbatim and printed and circulated in national\nschools and other charitable institutions, was received\nwith universal laughter. An amended version was\nplaced on the record and, strange to say, it was only\nreported by the opposition papers which do not, as\na rule, care to publish outbursts of this description.\n\nThe Upsala bench again craved permission to\nspeak. The speaker quite agreed with the last\nspeaker; his acute ear had caught something of\nthe old rattling of swords. He would like to say\nafew words. He would like to speak of the idea of a\njoint-stock company as an idea, but begged to be\nallowed to explain to the Chamber that a joint-stock\ncompany was not an accumulation of funds, not\na combination of people, but a moral personality,\nand as such not responsible . . .\u201d\n\nShouts of laughter and loud conversation prevented\nthe reporters from hearing the remainder of the\nargument, which closed with the remark that the\n", "interests of the country were at stake, conformable\nto the idea, and that, if the motion were rejected\nthe interests of the country would be neglected and\nthe State in danger.\n\nSix speakers filled up the interval until dinner-\ntime by giving extracts from the official statistics\nof Sweden, Nauman\u2019s Fundamental Statutes, the\nLegal Textbook and the G\u00e9teberg Commercial\nGazette: the conclusion invariably arrived at was\nthat the country was in danger if his Majesty were\nto be jointly and severally liable for all joint-stock\ncompanies the statutes of which he had sanctioned ;\nand that the interests of the whole country were at\nstake. One of the speakers was bold enough to say\nthat the interests of the country stood on a throw\nof the dice ; others were of opinion that they stood\non a card, others again that they hung on a thread ;\nthe last speaker said they hung on a hair.\n\nAt noon the proposition to go into Committee on\nthe motion was rejected ; that was to say, there was\nno need for the country to go through the Committee-\nmill, the office-sieve, the Imperial chaff-cutter, the\nclub-winnower and the newspaper-hubbub.

Each guessed the thoughts of the other,\nand both realized that the first who broke the silence\nwould say something foolish and compromising. They\ncast about for fresh subjects of conversation, mentally\nexamined them and found them unsuitable; every\none of them had some connexion with what had been\nsaid, or could be brought into connexion with it.\nFalk would have liked to have reason for finding fault\nwith the breakfast, so as to have an excuse for express-\ning indignation ; Mrs. Falk looked out of the window,\nfeebly hoping that there might be a change in the\nweather\u2014in vain.\n\nA maid-servant entered and saved the situation by\noffering them a tray with the newspapers, at the same\ntime announcing Mr. Levin.\n\n\u2018* Ask him to wait,\u201d said the master curtly.\n\nFor a few moments his boots squeaked up and down\nthe room, preparing the visitor who was waiting in the\ncorridor for his arrival.\n\nThe trembling Levin, greatly impressed by the\nnewly invented waiting in the corridor, was ultimately\nconducted into the master\u2019s private room, where he\nwas received like a petitioner.\n\n\u201c* Have you brought the bill of exchange with you ?\u201d\nasked Falk.\n\n**T think so,\u201d replied the crestfallen Levin, pro-\nducing a bundle of guarantees and blank bills of\nvarious values. \u2018*Whichbankdo youprefer?

The audience was over.\n", "CHAPTER X\n\nTHE NEWSPAPER SYNDICATE \u201cGREY\nBONNET\u201d\nFor forty years Sweden had worked for the right\nwhich every man obtains when he comes of age.\nPamphlets had been written, newspapers founded,\nstones thrown, suppers eaten and speeches made ;\nmeetings had been held, petitions had been pre-\nsented, the railways had been used, hands had been\npressed, volunteer regiments had been formed ; and\nso, in the end, with a great deal of noise, the desired\nobject had been attained. Enthusiasm was great\nand justifiable. The old birchwood tables at the\nOpera Restaurant were transformed into political\ntribunes ; the fumes of the reform-punch attracted\nmany a politician, who, later on, became a great\nscreamer ; the smell of reform cigars excited many an\nambitious dream which was never realized ; the old\ndust was washed off with reform soap; it was\ngenerally believed that everything would be right\nnow ; and after the tremendous uproar the country\nlay down and fell asleep, confidently awaiting the\nbrilliant results which were to be the outcome of all\nthis fuss.\n\nIt slept for a few years, and when it awoke it was\nfaced by a reality which suggested a miscalculation.\nThere were murmurs here and there; the statesmen\nwho had recently been Jauded to the skies were now\ncriticized. There were even, among the students,\nsome who discovered that the whole movement\nhad originated in a country which stood in very close\nrelationship to the promotor of the Bill, and that\n\n113 H\n", "ll4 THE RED ROOM\n\nthe original could be found in a well-known handbook.\nBut enough of it! Characteristic of these days was\na certain embarrassment which soon took the form\nof universal discontent or, as it was called, opposition.\nBut it was a new kind of opposition ; it was not, as\nis generally the case, directed against the Govern-\nment, but against Parliament. It was a Conservative\nopposition including Liberals as well as Conservatives,\nyoung men as well as old; there was much misery\nin the country.\n\nNow it i an that the newspaper syndicate\nGrey Bonnet, born and grown up under Liberal\nauspices, fell asleep when it was called upon to\ndefend unpopular views\u2014if one may speak of the\nviews of a syndicate. The directors proposed at the\nGeneral Meeting that certain opinions should be\nchanged, as they had the effect of decreasing the\nnumber of subscribers, necessary to the continuance\nof the enterprise. The General Mecting agreed to\nthe proposition, and the Grey Bonnet became a\nConservative paper. But there was a but, although\nit must be confessed that it did not greatly embarrass\nthe syndicate ; it was necessary to have a new chief\neditor to save the syndicate from ridicule ; that no\nchange need be made so far as the invisible editorial\nstaff was conecrned, went without saying. The chief\neditor, \u00ab man of honour, tendered his resignation.\nThe editorial management, which had long been\nabused on account of its red colour, accepted it with\npleasure, hoping thereby, without further trouble, to\ntake rank as a better class paper. \u2018There only re-\nmained the necessity of finding a new chief editor.\nIn accordance with the new programme of the\nsyndieate, he would have to possess the following\nqualifications: he must be known as a perfectly\ntrustworthy citizen; must belong to the official\nclass ; must possess a title, usurped or won, which\ncould be elaborated if necessity arose. In addition\nto this he must be of good appearance, so that one\ncould show him off at festivals and on other public\n", "THE NEWSPAPER SYNDICATE \u201cGREY BONNET\u201d 115\noccasions; he must be dependent; a little stupid,\nbecause true stupidity always goes hand in hand with <\nConservative leanings; he must be endowed with a_\ncertain amount of shrewdness, which would enable\nhim to know intuitively the wishes of his chiefs and\nnever let him forget that public and private welfare\nare, rightly understood, one and the same thing.\nAt the same time he must not be too young, because\nan older man is more easily managed; and finally,\nhe must be married, for the syndicate, which con-\nsisted of business men, knew perfectly well that\nmarried slaves are more amenable than unmarried\nones.\n\nThe individual was discovered, and he was to a.\nhigh degree endowed with all the characteristics\nenumerated. He was a strikingly handsome man\nwith a fairly fine figure and a long, wavy beard,\nhiding all the weak points of his face, which otherwise\nwould have given himaway. His large, full, deceitful\neyes caught the casual observer and inspired his\nconfidence, which was then unscrupulously abused.\nHis somewhat veiled voice, always speaking words\nof love, of peace, of honour and above all of patriotism,\nbeguiled many a misguided listener, and brought\nhim to the punch table where the excellent man\nspent his evenings, preaching straightforwardness and\nlove of the Mother Country.\n\nThe influence which this man of honour exerted\non his evil environment was marvellous; it could\nnot be seen, but it could be heard. The whole pack,\nwhich for years had been let loose on everything\ntime-honoured and venerable, which had not even\nlet alone the higher things, was now restrained and\nfull of love\u2014not only for its old friends\u2014was now\u2014\nand not merely in its heart\u2014moral and straight-\nforward. They carried out in every detail the '\nprogramme drawn up by the new editor on his\naccession, the cardinal points of which, expressed in a\nfew words, were: to persecute all good ideas if they\nwere new, to fight for and uphold all bad ones if they\n", "were old, to grovel before those in power, to extol all\nthose on whom fortune was smiling, to push down all\nthose who strove to rise, to adore success and abuse\nmisfortune. Freely translated the programme read :\nto acknowledge and cheer only the tested and ad-\nmittedly good, to work against the mania of innova-\ntion, and to persecute severely, but justly, everybody\nwho was trying to get on by dishonest means, for\nhonest work only should be crowned with success.\n\nThe secret of the last clause which the editorial\nstaff had principally at heart was not difficult to\ndiscover. The staff consisted entirely of people\nwhose hopes had been disappointed in one way or\nanother ; in most cases by their own fault\u2014through\ndrinking and recklessness. Some of them were\n\u201ccollege geniuses,\u201d who in the per had enjoyed a\ngreat reputation as singers, speakers, poets or wits,\nand had then justly\u2014or according to them unjustly\u2014\nbeen forgotten. During a number of years it had\nbeen their business to praise and promote, frequently\nagainst their own inclination, everything that was\nnew, all the enterprises started by reformers ; it was,\ntherefore, not strange that now they seized the\nopportunity to attack\u2014under the most honourable\npretexts\u2014everything new, good or bad.\n\nThe chief cditor in particular was great in tracking\nhumbug and dishonesty. Whenever a _ delegate\nopposed a Bill which tended to injure the interests\nof the country for the sake of the party, he was\nimmediately taken to task and called a humbug,\ntrying to be original, longing for a ministerial dress-\ncoat ; he did not say portfolio, for he always thought\nof clothes first. Politics, however, was not his\nstrong, or rather his weak point, but literature.\nIn days long past, on the occasion of the Old Norse\nFestival at Upsala, he had proposed a toast in verse\non woman, and thereby furnished an important\ncontribution to the literature of the world; it was\nprinted in as many provincial papers as the author\nconsidered necessary for his immortality. \u2018This had\n", "made him a poet, and when he had taken his degrees,\nhe bought a second-class ticket to Stockholm, in\norder to make his d\u00e9but in the world and reccive his\ndue. Unfortunately the Stockholmers do not read\nprovincial papers. The young man was unknown\nand his talent was not appreciated. As he was a\nshrewd man\u2014his small brain had never been\nexuberantly imaginative\u2014he concealed his wound\nand allowed it to become the secret of his life.\n\nThe bitterness engendered by the fact that his\nhonest work, as he called it, remained unrewarded\nspecially qualified him for the post of a literary censor ;\nbut he did not write himself: his position did not\nallow him to indulge in efforts of his own, and he pre-\nferred leaving it to the reviewer who criticized every-\nbody\u2019s work justly and with inflexible severity. The\nreviewer had written poetry for the last sixteen years\nunder a pseudonym. Nobody had ever read his\nverses and nobody had taken the trouble to discover\nthe author\u2019s real name. But every Christmas his\nverses were exhumed and praised in the Grey Bonnet,\nby a third party, of course, who signed his article so\nthat the public should not suspect that the author had\nwritten it himself\u2014it was taken for granted that the\nauthor was known to the public. In the seventeenth\nyear, the author considered it advisable to put his\nname to a new book\u2014a new edition of an old one.\nAs misfortune would have it, the Red Cap, the whole\nstaff of which was composed of young people who had\nnever heard the real name, treated the author as a\nbeginner, and expressed astonishment, not only that a\nyoung writer should put his name to his first book, but\nalso that a young man\u2019s book could be so monotonous\nand old-fashioned. This was a hard blow; the old\n*\u201c\u201cpseudonymus \u201d fell ill with fever, but recovered\nafter having been brilliantly rehabilitated by the Grey\nBonnet ; the latter went for the whole reading public\nin a lump, charging it with being immoral and dis-\nhonest, unable to appreciate an honest, sound, and\nmoral book which could safely be put into the hands\n", "ofachild. A comic paper made fun of the last point,\nso that the \u201c pseudonymus \u201d had a relapse, and, on\nhis second recovery, vowed annihilation to all native\nliterature which might appear in future ; it did, how-\never, not apply to quite all native literature, for a\nshrewd observer would have noticed that the Grey\nBonnet frequently praised bad books; true, it was\noften done lamely and in terms which could be read in\ntwo ways. \u2018The same shrewd observer could have\nnoticed that the miserable stuff in question was always\npublished by the same firm; but this did not neces-\nsarily imply that the reviewer was influenced by\nextrancous circumstances, such as little lunches, for\ninstance ; he and the whole editorial staff were up-\nright men who would surely not have dared to judge\nothers with so much severity if they themselves had\nnot been men of irreproachable character.\n\nAnother important member of the staff was the\ndramatic critic. He had received his education and\nqualified at a recruiting bureau in X-k\u00e9ping; had\nfallen in love with a \u201cstar\u201d? who was only a \u201cstar\u201d in\nX-k\u00e9ping. As he was not sufliciently enlightened to\ndifferentiate between a private opinion and a universal\nverdict, it happened to him when he was for the first\ntime let loose in the columns of the Grey Bonnei that\nhe slated the greatest actress in Sweden, and main-\ntained that she copied Miss\u2014, whatever her name was.\nThat it was donc very clumsily goes without saying,\nand also that it happened before the Grey Bonnet had\nveered round. All this made his name detested and\ndespised ; but still, he had a name, and that com-\npensated him for the indignation he excited. One of\nhis cardinal points, although not at once appreciated,\nwas his deafness. Several years went by before it was\ndiscovered, and even then nobody could tell whether\nor no it had any connexion with a certain encounter,\ncaused by one of his notices, in the foyer of the Opera\nHouse, one evening after the lights had been turned\ndown. After this encounter he tested the strength of\nhis arm only on quite young people; and anybody\n", "familiar with the circumstances could tell by his\ncritique when he had had an accident in the wings, for\nthe conceited provincial had read somewhere the un-\nreliable statement that Stockholm was anothcr Paris,\nand had believed it.\n\nThe art critic was an old academician who had\nnever held a brush in his hand, but was a member of\nthe brilliant artists club \u2018\u2018 Minerva,\u201d a fact which\nenabled him to describe works of art in the columns\nof his paper before they were finished, thereby saving\nthe reader the trouble of forming an opinion of his own.\nHe was invariably kind to his acquaintances, and in\ncriticizing an exhibition never forgot to mention every\nsingle one of them. His practice, of many years\u2019\nstanding, of saying something pretty about everybody\n\u2014and how would he have dared to do otherwise\u2014\nmade it child\u2019s play to him to mention twenty names\nin half a column ; in reading his reviews one could not\nhelp thinking of the popular game \u201cpictures and\ndevices.\u201d But the young artists he always con-\nscientiously forgot, so that the public, which, for ten\nyears had heard none but the old names, began to\ndespair of the future of art. One exception, however,\nhe had made, and made quite recently, in an unpro-\npitious hour; and in consequence of this exception\nthere was great excitement one morning in the\neditorial office of the Grey Bonnet.\n\nWhat had occurred was this: Sell\u00e9n\u2014the reader\nmay remember this insignificant name mentioned on\na former, and not a particularly important occasion\u2014\nhad arrived with his picture at the exhibition at the\nvery last moment. When it had been hung\u2014in the\nworst possible place\u2014for the artist was neither a\nmember of the Academy nor did he possess the royal\nmedal\u2014the \u2018professor of Charles IX\u201d arrived;\nhe had been given this nickname because he\nnever painted anything but scenes from the life of\nCharles IX ; the reason again for this was that a long\ntime ago he had bought at an auction a wine glass, a\ntablecloth, a chair, and a parchment from the period\n", "of Charles IX ; these objects he had painted for twenty\nyears, sometimes with, sometimes without, the king.\nBut he was a professor now and a knight of many\norders, and so there was no help for it. He was with\nthe academician when his eye fell on the silent man\nof the opposition and his picture.\n\n\u201cHere again, sir?\u201d He put up his pince-nez.\n\u201cAnd this, then, is the new style! Hm! Let me\ntell you, sir! Believe the word of an old man: take\nthat picture away! \u2018Take it away! It makes me\nsick to look at it. You do yourself the greatest\nservice if you take it away. What do you say, old\nfellow ?\u201d\u201d\n\nThe old fellow said that the exhibition of such a\npicture was an impertinence, and that if the gentle-\nman would take his kindly meant advice, he would\nchange his profession and become a_ signboard\npainter.\n\nSell\u00e9n replied mildly, but shrewdly, that there were\nso many able people in that profession, that he had\nchosen an artistic career where success could be\nobtained far more easily, as had been proved.\n\nThe professor was furious at this insolence; he\nturned his back on the contrite Sell\u00e9n with a threat\nwhich the academician translated into a promise.\n\nThe enlightened Committee of Purchases had met\u2014\nbehind closed doors. When the doors were opened\nagain, six pictures had been bought for the money\nsubseribed by the public for the purpose of encourag-\ning native artists. The excerpt from the minutes\nwhich found its way into the columns of the news-\npapers, was worded as follows :\n\n\u201cThe Art Union yesterday bought the following\npictures: (1) \u2018 Water with Oxen,\u2019 landscape by the\nwholesale merchant K. (2) \u2018Gustavus Adolphus at\nthe Fire of Magdeburg,\u2019 historical painting by the\nlinen draper L. (3) \u2018A Child blowing its Nose,\u2019\ngenre-picture by lieutenant M. (4) \u2018S. S. Bore in\nthe Harbour,\u2019 marine picture by the shipbroker N.\n(5) \u2018Sylvan Scene with Women,\u2019 landscape by the\n", "royal secretary O. (6) \u2018Chicken with Mushrooms,\u2019\nstill-life by the actor P.\u201d\n\nThese works of art, which cost a thousand pounds\neach on an average, were afterwards praised in the\nGrey Bonnet in two three-quarter columns at fifteen\ncrowns each; that was nothing extraordinary, but\nthe critic, partly in order to fill up the space, and partly\nin order to seize the right moment for suppressing a\ngrowing evil, attacked a bad custom which was be-\nginning to creep in. He referred to the fact that\nyoung, unknown adventurers, who had run away\nfrom the academy without study, were trying to\npervert the sound judgment of the public by a mere\nrunning after effect. And then Sell\u00e9n was taken by\nthe ears and flogged, so that even his enemies found\nthat his treatment was unfair\u2014and that means a\ngreat deal. Not only was he denied every trace of\ntalent and his art called humbug; even his private\ncircumstances were dragged before the public; the\narticle hinted at cheap restaurants where he was\nobliged to dine ; at the shabby clothes he was forced\nto wear; at his loose morals, his idleness; it con-\ncluded by prophesying in the name of religion and\nmorality that he would end his days in a public\ninstitution unless he mended his ways while there was\nyet time.\n\nIt was a disgraceful act, committed in indifference\nand selfishness ; and it was little less than a miracle\nthat a soul was not lost on the night of the publication\nof that particular number of the Grey Bonnet.\n\nTwenty-four hours later the Incorruptible appeared.\nIt reflected on the way in which public moneys were\nadministered by a certain clique, and mentioned the\nfact that at the last purchase of pictures, not a single\none had been bought which had been painted by an\nartist, but that the perpetrators had been officials and\ntradesmen, impudent enough to compete with the\nartists, although the latter had no other market ; it\nwent on to say that these pirates lowered the standard\nand demoralized the artists, whose sole endeavour\n", "would have to be to paint as badly as they did if they\ndid not want to starve. Then Sell\u00e9n\u2019s name was\nmentioned. His picture was the first soulfully con-\nceived work within the last ten years. For ten years\nart had been a mere affair of colours and brushes ;\nSell\u00e9n\u2019s picture was an honest piece of work, full of\ninspiration and devotion, and entirely original; a\npicture which could only have been produced by an\nartist who had met the spirit of nature face to face.\nThe critic enjoined the young artist to fight against\nthe ancients, whom he had already left a long way\nbehind, and exhorted him to have faith and hope,\nbecause he had a mission to fulfil, ete.\n\nThe Grey Bonnet foamed with rage.\n\n*\u201c You'll see that that fellow will have success !\u201d\nexclaimed the chief editor. \u2018\u2018 Why the devil did we\nslate him quite so much! Supposing he became a\nsuccess now! We should cover ourselves with\nridicule.\u201d\n\nThe academician vowed that he should not have\nany success, went home with a troubled heart, re-\nferred to his books and wrote an essay in which he\npraved that Sell\u00e9n\u2019s art was humbug, and that the\n\nneorruptible had been corrupted.\n\nThe Grey Bonnet drew a breath of relief, but\nimmediately afterwards it received a fresh blow.\n\nOn the following day the morning papers announced\nthe fact that his Majesty had bought Sell\u00e9n\u2019s\n\u2018\u201c\u201cmasterly landscape which, for days, had drawn a\nlarge public to the Exhibition.\u201d\n\nThe Grey Bonnet received the full fury of the gale ;\nit was tossed hither and thither, and fluttered like a\nrag on a pole. Should they veer round or steer\nahead ? Both paper and critic were involved. \u2018The\nchief editor decided, by order of the managing\ndirector, to sacrifice the critic and save the paper.\nBut how was it to be done ? In their extremity they\nremembered Struve. He was a man completely at\nhome in the maze of publicity. He was sent for.\nThe situation was clear to him in a moment, and- he\n", "promised that in a very few days the barge should be\nable to tack.\n\nTo understand Struve\u2019s scheme, it is necessary to\nknow the most important data of his biography. He\nwas a\u201c\u2018 born student,\u201d driven to journalism by sheer\n. He started his career as editor of the\n\nocialist People\u2019s Flag. Next he belonged to the\nConservative Peasants\u2019 Scourge, but when the latter\nremoved to the provinces with inventory, printing\nand editor, the name was changed into Peasants\u2019\n\nriend, and its politics changed accordingly. Struve\nwas sold to the Hed Cap, where his knowledge of all the\nConservative tricks stood him in good stead; in the\nsame way his greatest merit in the eyes of the Grey\nBonnet was his knowledge of all the secrets of their\ndeadly foe, the Red Cap, and his readiness to abuse\nhis knowledge of them.\n\nStruve began the work of whitewashing by starting\na correspondence in the People\u2019s Flag ; a few lines of\nthis, mentioning the rush of visitors to the Exhibition,\nwere reprinted in the Grey Bonnet. Next there\nappeared in the Grey Bonnet an attack on the academi-\ncian; this attack was followed by a few reassuring\nwords signed \u201c\u2018The Ed.\u201d which read as follows:\n\u2018\u201c* Although we never shared the opinion of our art\ncritic with regard to Mr. Sell\u00e9n\u2019s justly praised land-\nscape, yet we cannot altogether agree with the\njudgment of our respected correspondent ; but as, on\nprinciple, we open our columns to all opinions, we un-\nhesitatingly printed the above article.\u201d\n\nThe ice was broken. Struve, who had the reputa-\ntion of having written on every subject\u2014except cufic\ncoins\u2014now wrote a brilliant critique of Sell\u00e9n\u2019s\npicture and signed it very characteristically Dixi.\nThe Grey Bonnet was saved ; and so, of course, was\nSell\u00e9n ; but the latter was of minor importance.\n", "CHAPTER XI\n\nHAPPY PEOPLE\nIr was seven o\u2019cloeck in the evening. The band at\nBerns\u2019 was playing the Wedding March from \u2018A\nMidsummer Night\u2019s Dream,\u201d when to the accom-\npaniment of its inspiriting strains Olle Montanus\nmade his entry into the Red Room. None of the\nmembers had yet arrived. Olle looked imposing.\nFor the first time since his confirmation he was\nwearing a high hat. He was dressed in a new suit,\nand his boots were without holes ; he had had a bath,\nhad been newly shaved, and his hair was waved as if\nhe were going to a wedding. A heavy brass chain\nornamented his waistcoat, and his left waistcoat\npocket bulged visibly. A sunny smile lit up his\nfeatures; he radiated kindness; one might have\nthought that he wanted to help all the world with\nlittle loans. Taking off his overeoat, no longer\ncautiously buttoned up, he took the centre of the\nsofa in the background, opened his coat and tugged\nat his white shirt front so that it rose with a crackle\nand stood out like an arch ; at every movement the\nlining of his waistcoat and trousers creaked. This\nseemed to give him as much pleasure as the knocking\nof his boot against the leg of the sofa. He pulled out\nhis wateh, his dear old turnip, which for a year and\na month\u2019s grace had been in the pawnbroker\u2019s hands,\nand the two old friends both seemed to enjoy its\nliberty.\n\nWhat had happened that this poor fellow should be\nso inexpressibly happy ? We know that he had not\ndrawn the winner in a lottery, that he had not\n\n124\n", "inherited a fortune, that he had not been \u00ab\u2018 honourably\nmentioned,\u201d that he had not won the sweet happiness\nwhich baffles description. What had happened then ?\nSomething very commonplace : he had found work.\n\nSell\u00e9n was the next to arrive. He wore a velvet\njacket and patent-leather boots; he carried a rug,\na field-glass on a strap, and a cane; a yellow silk\nhandkerchief was knotted round his throat; his\nhands were covered by flesh-coloured gloves and a\nflower blossomed in his buttonhole. He was, as\nusual, cheerful and calm; his lean, intelligent face\nbetrayed no trace of the emotions undergone during\nthe last few days.\n\nSell\u00e9n was accompanied by Rehnhjelm; the lad\nwas unusually subdued ; he knew that his friend and\npatron was leaving him.\n\n\u201cHallo! Sell\u00e9n,\u201d said Olle, \u201c you are happy at\nlast, aren\u2019t you, old chap ? \u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018Happy ? What nonsense you are talking! I\u2019ve\nsold a piece of work! The first in five years! Is\nthat so overwhelming ? \u201d\n\n\u201cBut you must have read the papers! Your\nname\u2019s made!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! I don\u2019t care the toss of a button for that !\nDon\u2019t imagine that I care for such trifles. I know\nexactly how much I still have to learn before I shall\nbe anybody. Let\u2019s talk of it again in ten years\u2019\ntime, Olle.\u201d\n\nOlle believed half of what Sell\u00e9n said and doubted\nthe rest; his shirt front crackled and the lining\ncreaked so that Sell\u00e9n\u2019s attention was aroused.\n\n\u2018\u201c* By the Lord Harry!\u201d he burst out, \u201c you are\nmagnificent ! \u201d\n\n\u201cThink so? You look like a lion.\u201d\u2019\n\nSell\u00e9n rapped his patent-leather boots with his cane,\nshyly smelt the flower in his buttonhole, and looked\nindifferent. Olle pulled out his watch to see whether\nit was not yet time for Lundell to arrive, which gave\nSell\u00e9n an opportunity of sweeping the galleries with\nhis field-glass. Olle was permitted to feel the soft\n", "texture of the velvet coat, while Sell\u00e9n assured him\nthat it was an exceptionally good quality at the\nprice ; Olle could not resist asking the cost. Sell\u00e9n\ntold him, and admired Olle\u2019s studs, which were made\nof shells.\n\nPresently Lundell appeared; he, too, had been\ngiven a bone at the great banquet; he was com-\nmissioned to paint the altar-piece for the church of\nTraskola for a small sum; but this had not visibly\naffected his outward appearance, unless, indeed, his\nfat cheeks and beaming face hinted at a more generous\ndiet.\n\nFalk was with Lundell. He was grave, but he\nrejoiced, in the name of the whole world sincerely\nrejoiced, that merit had found its just reward.\n\n\u201cCongratulations, Sell\u00e9n!\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018but it\u2019s no\nmore than your due.\u201d\n\nSell\u00e9n agreed.\n\n\u2018*T have been painting just as well these last five\nyears and all the world has jeered; they were still\njeering the day before yesterday, but now! It\u2019s\ndisgusting !_ Look at this letter which I received from\nthe idiot, the professor of Charles IX !\n\nAll eyes opened wide and became keen, for it is\ngratifying to examine the oppressor closely, have him\n\u2014on paper at least\u2014in one\u2019s hands, at one\u2019s merey.\n\n\u201c\u201c* My dear Mr. Sell\u00e9n,\u2019\u2014Faney that !\u2014\u2018 Let me\nwelcome you among us \u2019\u2014he\u2019s afraid of me, the\nblackguard\u2014\u2018 I have always appreciated your\ntalent \u2019\u2014the liar !\u2014let\u2019s tear up the rag and forget\nall about him.\u201d\n\nSell\u00e9n invited his friends to drink; he drank to\nFalk, and hoped that his pen would soon bring him\nto the front. Falk became self-conscious, blushed\nand promised to do his best when his time came ; but\nhe was afraid that his apprenticeship would be a long\none, and he begged his friends not to lose patience\nwith him if he tarried; he thanked Sell\u00e9n for his\nfriendship, which had taught him endurance and\nrenunciation, Sell\u00e9n begged him not to talk non-\n", "sense ; where was the merit of endurance when there\nwas no other alternative ? And where was the virtue\nin renouncing what one had no chance of obtaining ?\n\nBut Olle smiled a kindly smile, and his shirt front\nswelled with pleasure, so that the red braces could be\nplainly seen ; he drank to Lundell and implored him\nto take an example from Sell\u00e9n, and not forget the\nLand of Promise in lingering over the fleshpots of\nEgypt. He assured him that his friend, Olle, believed\nin his talent, that. was to say, when he was himself\nand painted according to his own light ; but whenever\nhe humbugged and painted to aps others he was\nworse than the rest ; therefore he should look upon\nthe altar-piece as a pot boiler which would put fim\ninto a position to follow his own inspiration in art.\n\nFalk tried to seize the opportunity of finding out\nwhat Olle thought of \u2018caneell and his own art, a puzzle\nwhich he had long vainly attempted to solve, when\nYgberg walked into the Red Room. Everybody\n\u2018eagerly invited him to be his guest, for he had been\nforgotten during the last hot days, and everyone was\nanxious to show him that it had not been out of\nselfishness. But Olle searched in his right waistcoat\npocket, and with a movement which he was anxious\nto hide from all eyes he slipped a rolled-up banknote\ninto Ygberg\u2019s coat pocket ; the latter understood and\nacknowledged it by a grateful look.\n\nYgberg drank to Sell\u00e9n; he said that one might\nconsider, in one way, that Sell\u00e9n\u2019s fortune was made ;\nbut, on the other hand, one might consider, with equal\njustification, that it was not so. Sell\u00e9n was not\nsufficiently developed ; he still wanted many years\u2019\nstudy, for art was long, as he, Ygberg, had himself\nexperienced. He had had nothing but ill-luck, there-\nfore nobody could suspect him of envying a man of\nSell\u00e9n\u2019s reputation.\n\nThe envy which peered through Ygberg\u2019s words\nslightly clouded the sunny sky ; but it was only for\na moment, for everybody realized that the bitterness\nof a long, wasted life, must be held responsible for it,\n", "All the more gladly Ygberg handed Falk a small\nnewly printed essay, on the cover of which he beheld\nwith consternation the black portrait of Ulrica\nEleonora. Ygberg stated that he had delivered the\nmanuscript on the day stipulated. Smith had taken\nFalk\u2019s refusal with the greatest calm, and was now\nprinting Falk\u2019s poems.\n\nTo Falk\u2019s eyes the gas-jets lost their brilliancy ;\nhe sat plunged in deep thought ; his heart was too\nfull to find vent in words. His poems were to be\nprinted at Smith\u2019s expense. This was proof that\nthey were not without merit! The thought was\nsufficient food for the whole evening.\n\nThe evening passed quickly for the happy circle ;\nthe band ceased playing and the light was turned out ;\nthey were obliged to leave, but, finding the night far\ntoo young for breaking up, they strolled along the\nquays, amid endless conversation and philosophical\ndiscussions, until they were tired and thirsty. Lundell\noffered to take his friends to see Marie, where they\ncould have some beer.\n\nThey turned towards the north and came to a\nstreet which gave on a fence; the fence enclosed a\ntobacco field, bordering on the open country. They\nstopped before a two-storied brick-house with a gable\nfacing the street. From above the door grinned two\nsandstone faces whose ears and shins were lost in\nfantastic scrolls. Between the heads hung a sword\nand an axe. It was formerly the house of the\nexecutioner.\n\nLundell, apparently quite familiar with the neigh-\nbourhood, gave a signal before one of the windows\non the ground floor; the blind was drawn up; the\nwindow opened, and a woman\u2019s head looked out ;\na voice asked whether the caller was Albert ? No\nsooner had Lundell owned to this, his nom de guerre,\nthan a girl opened the door and, on the promise of\nsilence, admitted the party. As the promise was\nreadily given, the Red Room was soon in her apart-\nment, and introduced to her under fictitious names.\n", "The room was not a large one; it had once been\nthe kitchen, and the range was still standing in its\nplace. The furniture consisted of a chest of drawers,\nof a pattern usually found in servants\u2019 rooms; on\nthe drawers stood a looking-glass, swathed in a piece\nof white muslin; above the glass hung a coloured\nlithograph, representing the Saviour on the Cross.\nThe chest was littered with small china. figures, scent\nbottles, a prayer book, and an ash tray, and with its\nlooking-glass and two lighted tallow candles seemed\nto form a little house altar. Charles XV, surrounded\nby newspaper cuttings, mostly representing police\nconstables, those enemies of the Magdalenes, was\nriding on horseback on the wall above the folding\nsofa, which had not yet been converted into a bed.\nOn the window-sill stood a stunted fuchsia, a geranium\nand a myrtle\u2014the proud tree of Aphrodite in the\npoor dwelling. A photograph album lay on the\nwork-table. On the first leaf was a picture of the\nKing, on the second and third papa and mamma\u2014\npoor country folk; on the fourth a student, the\nseducer ; on the fifth, a baby ; and on the sixth the\nfianc\u00e9, a journeyman. This was her history, so like\nthe history of most of them. On a nail, close to the\nrange, hung an elegant dress, a velvet cloak, and a\nhat with feathers\u2014the fairy disguise in which she\nwent out to catch young men. The fairy herself was\na tall, ordinary looking young woman of twenty-four,\nRecklessness and vigils had given her face that white\ntransparency which as a rule distinguishes the un-\ntoiling rich, but her hands still showed traces of hard\nwork. In her pretty dressing-gown, with her flowing\nhair down her back, she was the picture of a Magdalene ;\nher manner was comparatively shy, but she was\nmerry and courteous and on her best behaviour.\n\nThe party split up into groups, continued the\ninterrupted discussions and started fresh ones. Falk,\nwho now looked upon himself as a poet and was\ndetermined to be interested in everything\u2014be it ever\nso banal\u2014began a sentimental conversation with\n\nI\n", "Marie, which she greatly enjoyed, for she appreciated\nthe honour of being treated like a human being. As\nusual the talk drifted to her story and the motives\nwhich had shaped her career. She did not lay stress\non her first slip, \u201cthat was hardly worth speaking\nabout\u201d; but all the blacker was her account of the\ntime she had spent as a servant, leading the life of\na slave, made miserable by the whims and scoldings of\nan indolent mistress, a life of never-ending toil. No,\nthe free life she was leading now was far preferable.\n\n\u2018** But when you are tired of it ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I shall marry Vestergren.\u201d\u2019\n\n** Does he want you ?\u201d\n\n\u201c*He\u2019s looking forward to the day; moreover, I\nam going to open a little shop with the money I have\nsaved. But so many have asked me that question :\n\u2018Have you got any cigars ?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes; here you are! But do you mind my\ntalking about it ? \u201d\n\nHe took the album and pointed out the student\u2014\nit is always a student, with a white handkerchief\nround his neck, a white student\u2019s hat on his knees,\nand a gauche manner, who plays Mephisto.\n\n\u2018Who is this ?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* We was a nice fellow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe seducer ?. What ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! let it alone! I was every bit as much to\nblame, and it is always so, my dear; both are to\nblame! Look, this is my baby. The Lord took it,\nand I dare say it was for the best. But now let\u2019s\ntalk about something else. Who is that gay dog\nwhom Albert has brought here to-night ? The one\nclosest to the stove, by the side of the tall one, whose\nhead reaches up to the chimney ?\u201d\n\nOlle, very much flattered by her attention, patted\nhis wavy hair which, after the many libations, was\nbeginning to stand up again.\n\n\u201cThat is assistant preacher Monsson,\u201d\u2019 said\nLundell.\n\n\u201cUh! A clergyman! I might have known it\n", "from the cunning look in his eyes. Do you know\nthat a clergyman came here last week ? Come here,\nMonsson, and Ict me look at you!\u201d\n\nOlle descended from his seat where he and Ygberg\nhad been criticizing Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative.\nHe was so accustomed to exciting the curiosity of the\nsex that he immediately felt younger; he lurched\ntowards the lady whom he had already ogled and\nfound charming. \u2018Twirling his moustache, he asked\nin an affected voice, with a bow which he had not\nlearned at a dancing class :\n\n\u201cDo you really think, miss, that I look like a\nclergyman ? \u201d\n\n* No, I see now that you have a moustache ; your\nclothes are too clean for an artisan\u2014may I see your\nhand\u2014oh ! you are a smith!\u201d\n\nOlle was deeply hurt.\n\n** Am Iso very ugly, miss ? \u201d he asked pathetically.\n\nMarie examined him for a moment.\n\n\u201cYou are very plain,\u201d\u2019 she said, \u201c\u2018 but you look\nnice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, dear lady, if you only knew how you are\nhurting me! I have never yet found a woman ready\nto love me, and yet I have met so many who found\nhappiness although they were plainer than I am.\nBut woman is a cursed riddle, which nobody can\nsolve ; I detest her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Olle,\u201d came a voice from the\nchimney, where Ygberg\u2019s head was; \u2018\u2018that\u2019s all\nright.\u201d\n\nOlle was going back to the stove, but he had\ntouched on a topic which interested Marie too much\nto allow it to drop; he had played on a string the\nsound of which she knew. She sat down by his side\nand soon they were deep in a long-winded and grave\ndiscussion\u2014on love and women.\n\nRehnhjelm, who during the whole evening had been\nmore quiet and restrained than usual, and of whom\nnobody could make anything, suddenly revived and\nwas now sitting in the corner of the sofa near Falk.\n", "Obviously something was troubling him, something\nwhich he could not make up his mind to mention.\nHe seized his beer-glass, rapped on the table as if he\nwanted to make a speech, and when those nearest to\nhim looked up ready to listen to him, he said in a\ntremulous and indifferent voice :\n\n** Gentlemen, you think I am a beast, I know;\nFalk, I know you think me a fool, but you shall see,\nfriends\u2014the devil take me, you shall see ! \u201d\n\nHe raised his voice and put his beer-glass down\nwith such determination that it broke in pieces, after\nwhich he sank back on the sofa and fell asleep.\n\nThis scene, although not an uncommon one, had\nattracted Marie\u2019s attention. She dropped the con-\nversation with Olle, who, moreover, had begun to\nstray from the purely abstract point of the question\nand rose.\n\n\u201cOh! what a pretty boy!\u201d she exclaimed.\n\u201c\u201cTlow does he come to be with you? Poor little\nchap! ow sleepy he is! I hadn\u2019t seen him\nbefore.\u201d\u201d\n\nShe pushed a cushion under his head and covered\nhim with a shawl.\n\n\u201cHow small his hands are! Far smaller than\nyours, you country louts!) And what a face! How\ninnocent he looks! Albert, did you make him\ndrink so much ? \u201d\n\nWhether it had been Lundell or another was a\nmatter of no importance now ; the man was drunk.\nBut it also was a fact that he did not need any urging\nto drink. He was consumed by a constant longing\nto still] an inner restlessness which seemed to drive\nhim away from his work.\n\nThe remarks made by his pretty friend had not\nperturbed Lundell ;_ but now his inereasing intoxieca-\ntion exeited his religious feelings, which had been\nblunted by a luxurious supper. And as the intoxica-\ntion began to be general, he felt it incumbent on him\nto remind his companions of the significance of the\nday and the impending leave-taking. He rose, filled\n", "his glass, steadied himself against the chest of drawers\nand claimed the attention of the party.\n\n* Gentlemen,\u2019\u201d\u2019\u2014he remembered Magdalene\u2019s pre-\nsence\u2014\u2018 and ladies! We have eaten and drunk\nto-night with\u2014to come to the point\u2014an_ intent\nwhich, if we set aside the material which is nothing\nbut the low, sensual animal component of our nature\n\u2014that in a moment like this when the hour of parting\nis imminent\u2014we have here a distressing example of\nthe vice which we call drunkenness! Doubtless, it\narouses all one\u2019s religious emotion if, after an evening\nspent in a circle of friends, one feels moved to propose\na glass to him who has shown more than ordinary\ntalent\u2014I am speaking of Sell\u00e9n\u2014one should think\nthat self-respect should to a certain extent prevail.\nSuch an example, I maintain, has been manifested\nhere, in higher potency, and therefore I am reminded\nof the beautiful words which will never cease ringing\nin my ears as long as I am able to think, and I am\nconvinced they are now in the mind of each one of\nus, although this spot is anything but suitable.\nThis young man, who has fallen a victim to the vice\nwhich we will call drunkenness, has unfortunately\ncrept into our circle and\u2014to cut my speech short\u2014\nmatured a sadder result than anybody could have\nexpected. Your health, noble friend Sell\u00e9n! I wish\nyou all the happiness which your noble heart deserves !\nYour health, Olle Montanus! Falk, too, has a noble\nheart, and will come to the front when his religious\nsense has acquired the vigour which his character\nforeshadows. I won\u2019t mention Ygberg, for he has\nat last come to a decision, and we wish him luck in\nthe career upon which he has so splendidly entered\u2014\nthe philosophical career. It is a difficult one, and\nI repeat the words of the psalmist : Who can tell ?\nAt the same time we have every reason to hope for\nthe best in the future, and I believe that we can\ncount on it as long as our sentiments are noble and\nour hearts are not striving for worldly gain; for,\ngentlemen, a man without religion is a beast. I\n", "therefore ask every gentleman here present to raise\nhis glass and empty it to all that is noble, beautiful,\nand splendid, and for which we are striving. Your\nhealth, gentlemen ! \u201d\n\nReligious emotion now overwhelmed Lundell to\nsuch a degree that it was thought best to break up the\nparty.\n\nDaylight had been shining through the window-\nblind for some time and the landscape with the\neastle and the maiden stood out brilliantly in the\nfirst radianee of the morning sun. When the blind\nwas drawn up, day rushed in and illuminated the\nfaces of those nearest the window ; they were deadly\npale. The red light of the tallow candles fell with\nmagnificent effect on the face of Ygberg, who was\nsitting on the stove, clutching his glass. Olle was\nproposing toasts to women, the spring, the sun, the\nuniverse, throwing open the window, to give vent\nto his feelings. The sleepers were roused, the party\ntook their leave of Marie, and filed through the front\ndoor.\n\nWhen they had reached the street, Falk turned\nround. Magdalene was leaning out of the window ;\nthe rays of the sun fell on her pale face ; her long,\nblack hair, which shone deep red in the sunlight,\nscemed to trickle down her throat and over her\nshoulders and to be falling on the street in little\nstreams. Above her head hung the sword and the\naxe and the two grinning faces ; but in an apple tree\non the other side of the road perehed a black and\nwhite fly-cateher, and sang its frenzied song of joy\nthat the night was over.\n", "CHAPTER XII\n\nMARINE INSURANCE SOCIETY \u201c TRITON \u201d\nLevi was a young man born and educated for business\nand on the point of establishing himself with the\nassistance of his wealthy father, when the latter\nig leaving nothing but a family totally unprovided\nor.\n\nThis was a great disappointment to the young man ;\nhe had reached an age when he considered that he\nmight stop working altogether and let others toit for\nhim. He was twenty-five and of good appearance.\nBroad-shouldered and lean in the flank, his body\nseemed specially adapted for wearing a frock-coat in\nthe manner which he had much admired in certain\nforeign diplomatists. Nature had arched his chest in\nthe most elegant fashion, so that he was capable of\nsetting off to the fullest advantage a four-buttoned\nshirt front, even in the very act of sinking into an\neasy chair at the foot of a long Board-table occupied\nby the whole Administrative Committee. A beautiful\nbeard, parted in the middle, gave his young face a\nsympathetic and trustworthy expression; his smal]\nfeet were made for walking on the Brussels carpet of a\n- Board-room, and his carefully manicured hands were\nparticularly suitable for very light work, such as the\nsigning of his name, preferably on a printed circular.\n\nIn the days which are now called the good days,\nalthough in reality they were very bad ones for a\ngood many people, the greatest discovery of a great\ncentury was made, namely, that one could live more\ncheaply and better on other people\u2019s money than on\n\u2018the results of one\u2019s own eilorts. Many, a great many,\n\n135 '\n", "people had taken advantage of the discovery, and as\nno patent law protected it, it was not surprising\nthat Levi should be anxious to profit by it, too, more\nparticularly as he had no money himself and no\ninclination to work for a family which was not his\nown. He, therefore, put on his best suit one day and\nealled on his uncle Smith.\n\n\u201cOh, indeed! You have an idea,\u201d said Smith,\n\u201c* Let\u2019s hear it! It\u2019s a good thing to have ideas ! \u201d\n\n\u201cIT have been thinking of floating a joint stock\ncompany.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cVery good. Aaron will be treasurer, Simon\nsecretary, Isaac cashier, and the other boys book-\nkeepers; it\u2019s a good idea! Goon! What sort of a\ncompany is it going to be ?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* T\u2019m thinking of a marine insurance society.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed! So far so good; everybody has to\ninsure his property when he goes on a voyage. But\nyour idea?\u201d\n\nThis is my idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think muchof it. We have the big society\n\u2018Neptune.\u2019 It\u2019s a good society. Yours would\nhave to be better if you intend to compete with it.\nWhat would be the novelty in your society ? \u201d\n\n\u201cOh! I understand! I should reduce the pre-\nmiums and all the patrons of the \u2018 Neptune\u2019 would\ncome to me.\u201d\n\n\u201c'That\u2019s better! Very well, then, the prospectus\nwhich I would print would begin in this way: \u2018 As\nthe crying need of reducing the marine insurance\npremiums has long been felt, and it is only owing\nto the want of competition that it has not yet been\u201d\ndone, we, the undersigned, beg to invite the public\nto take up shares in the new society. ... What\nname ?\u201d\n\n\u201cTriton.\u201d\n\n\u201cTriton ? What sort of a chap was he ?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c Tie was a sea-god.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, Triton. It will make a good poster !\nYou ean order it from Ranch in Berlin, and we will\n", "reproduce it in my almanac \u2018 Our Country.\u2019 Now for\nthe undersigned. First, of course, my name. We must\nhave big, well-sounding names. Give me the official\nalmanac.\u201d\n\nSmith turned over the leaves for some time.\n\n\u2018A marine insurance company must have a naval\nofficer of high rank. Let me see! An admiral.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Those sort of people have no money !\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c\u201c Bless me! You don\u2019t know much about business,\nmy boy! \u2018They are only wanted to subscribe, not to\npay up! And they receive their dividends for\nattending the meetings and being present at the\ndirectors\u2019 dinners! Here we have two admirals ;\none of them has the Commander\u2019s Ribbon of the Polar\nStar, and the other one has the Russian Order of\nAnna. Whatshallwedo? I think we had better take\nthe Russian, for there is splendid marine insurance\nground in Russia... There!\u201d\n\n** But is it such a simple matter to get hold of these\npeople ?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cTut, tut! Next we want a retired minister of\nState! Yes! Well! \u2018They are called Your Excel-\nlency! Yes! Good. And a Count! That\u2019s more\ndifficult !_ Counts have lots of money! And we must\nhave a professor! They have no money! Is there\nsuch a thing as a Professor of Navigation? \u2018That\nwould be a capital thing for our venture! Isn\u2019t there\na School of Navigation somewhere near the South\nTheatre? Yes? Very well! Everything is as clear\nas possible to me. Oh! I nearly forgot the most\nimportant point. We must have a legal man! A\ncounsellor of a high court. Here he is!\u201d \u00b0\n\n\u2018* But we have no money yet !\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cMoney ? What\u2019s the use of moncy in company\npromoting ? Doesn\u2019t the man who insures his goods\npay us money ? What? Ordo we pay him? No!\nWell then, he pays with his premiums.\u201d\n\n\u201c But the original capital ?\n\n** One issues debentures ! \u201d\n\n\u201cTrue, but there must be some cash ! \u201d\n", "\u201cOne pays cash in debentures! Isn\u2019t that paying ?\nSupposing I gave you a cheque for a sum, any bank\nwould cash it for you. \u2018Therefore, a cheque is money.\nVery well! And is there a law which ordains that\neash shall mean bank-notes ? If there were, what\nabout private bank-notes ?\u201d\n\n** How large should the capital be ? \u201d\n\n\u201cVery small! It\u2019s bad business to tie up large\nsums. <A million! Three hundred thousand in cash\nand the remainder in debentures.\u201d\n\n* But\u2014but\u2014but ! The three hundred thousand\ncrowns surely must be in bank-notes !\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c Good Lord in Heaven! Bank-notes ? Notes are\nmoney! If you have notes, well and good; if you\nhaven\u2019t, it comes to the same thing. \u2018Therefore, we\nmust interest the small capitalists, who have nothing\nbut bank-notes.\u201d\u2019\n\n*\u201c And the big ones ? Ifow do they pay ?\u201d\n\n\u201cTn shares, debenture guarantees, of course. But\nthat will be a matter for later on. Get them to\nsubscribe, and we\u2019ll see to the rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd only three hundred thousand ? One single\ngreat steamer costs as much. Supposing we insured\na thousand steamers ?\u201d\n\n\u201cA thousand ? Last year the \u2018 Neptune\u2019 issued\nforty-cight thousand insurance policies, and did well\nout of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the worse, I say! But if\u2014but if\u2014natters\nshould go wrong . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOne goes into liquidation ! \u201d\n\n** Liquidation ?\u201d\n\n** Declares oneself insolvent! \u2018That\u2019s the proper\nterm. And what does it matter if the society becomes\ninsolvent ? It isn\u2019t you, or I, or he! But one can\nalso inerease the number of shares, or issue debentures\nwhich the Government may buy up in hard times at a\ngood price.\u201d\n\n\u201c 'There\u2019s no risk then ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot the slightest! Besides what have you got\nto lose ? Do you possess one farthing ? No! Very\n", "well then! What doTrisk? Five hundred crowns !\nI shall only take five shares, you see! And five\nhundred is as much as this to me!\u201d\n\nHe took a pinch of snuff and the matter was\nsettled. -\n\nThe society was floated and during the first ten\nyears of its activity it paid 6, 10, 10, 11, 20, 11, 5,\n10, 36, and 20 per cent. The shares were eagerly\nbought up, and, in order to enlarge the business, more\nshares were issued; the new issuc of shares was\nfollowed by a general meeting of shareholders; Falk\nwas sent to report it for the Red Cap, whose assistant\nreporter he was.\n\nWhen, on a sunny afternoon in June, he entered the\nExchange, the hall was already crowded with people.\nIt was a brilliant assembly. Statesmen, geniuses,\nmen of letters, officers, and civil service men of high\nrank; uniforms, dress-coats, orders, and ribbons ;\nall those here assembled had one big general interest !\nThe advancement of the philanthropic institution\ncalled marine insurance. It required a great love to\nrisk one\u2019s money for the benefit of the suffering\nneighbour whom misfortune had befallen, but here\nwas love! Falk had never seen such an accumulation\nof it in one spot. Although not yet an entircly\ndisillusioned man, he could not suppress a feeling of\namazement.\n\nBut he was even more amazed when he noticed\nthe little blackguard Struve, the former Socialist,\ncreeping through the crowd like a reptile, greeted,\nand sometimes addressed by distinguished people\nwith a familiar nod, a pressure of the hand or a friendly\nslap on the shoulder. He saw a middle-aged man,\nwearing a ribbon belonging to a high order, nodding\nto him, and he noticed that Struve blushed and\nconcealed himself behind an embroidered coat. This\nbrought him into Falk\u2019s vicinity, and the latter\nimmediately accosted him and asked him who the\nman was. Struve\u2019s embarrassment increased, but\n", "summoning up all his impudence, he replied, \u2018\u201c\u2018 You\nought toknow that! He\u2019s the president of the Board\nof Payment of Employ\u00e9s\u2019 Salaries.\u2019\u201d\u201d No sooner had\nthe words left his lips than he pretended to be called\nto the other side of the room ; but he was in so great\na hurry that Falk wondered whether he felt uneom-\nfortable in his society? A blackguard in the company\nof an honourable man !\n\nThe brilliant assembly began to be seated. But the\npresident\u2019s chair was still vacant. Falk was looking\nfor the reporter\u2019s table, and when he discovered\nStruve and the reporter for the Conservative sitting\nat a table on the right-hand side of the secretary he\ntook his courage into his hands and marched through\nthe distinguished crowd ; just as he had reached the\ntable, the secretary stopped him with a question.\n\u201c\u201cFor which paper?\u2019 he asked. A momentary\nsilence ensued. \u2018* For the Red Cap,\u201d answered Falk,\nwith a slight tremor in his voice; he had recognized\nin the secretary the actuary of the Board of Payment\nof Employ\u00e9s\u2019 Salarics. A half-stifled murmur ran\nthrough the room; presently the secretary said in a\nloud voice : \u2018\u2018 Your place is at the back, over there ! \u201d\nHe pointed to the door and a small table\u2019 standing close\nto it.\n\nFalk realized in a moment the significance of the\nword \u2018 Conservative,\u201d? and also what it meant to be\na journalist who was not a Conservative. Boiling\ninwardly he retraced his footsteps, walking to his\nappointed place through the sneering crowd; he\nstared at the grinning faces, challenging them with\nburning eyes, when his glanee met another glance,\nquite in the background, close to the wall. The eyes,\nbearing a strong resemblance to a pair of eyes now\nclosed in death, whieh used to rest on his face full of\nlove, were green with malice and pierced him like a\nneedle; he could have shed tears of sorrow at the\nthought that a brother could thus look at a brother.\n\nIe took his modest place near the door, for he was\ndetermined not to beat a retreat. Very soon he was\n", "roused from his apparent calm by a newcomer who\nprodded him in the back as he took off his coat and\nshoved a pair of rubber over-shoes underneath his\nchair. The newcomer: was greeted by the whole\nassembly which rose from their seats as one man.\nHe was the chairman of the Marine Insurance Society\nLimited \u2018\u2018'Triton,\u2019\u2019 but he was something clse beside\nthis. He was a retired district-marshal, a baron, one\nof the eightcen of the Swedish Academy, an Excellency,\na knight of many orders, etc. etc.\n\nA rap with the hammer and amid dead silence the\npresident whispered the following oration: just\ndelivered by him at a mecting of the Coal Company\nLimited, in the hall of the Polytechnic.\n\n\u201cGentlemen! Amongst all the patriotic and\nphilanthropic enterprises there are few\u2014if any\u2014of\nsuch a noble and beneficial nature as an Insurance\nSociety.\u201d\n\nThis statement was received with a unanimous\n\u2018\u201c\u201c Hear ! hear ! \u201d? which, however, made no impression\non the district-marshal.\n\n*\u201c What else is life but a struggle, a life and death\nstruggle, one might say, with the forces of Nature!\nThere will be few among us who do not, sooner or later,\ncome into conflict with them.\u201d\n\n** Hear ! hear ! \u201d\n\n\u201cFor long ages man, more especially primitive\nman, has been the sport of the elements ; a ball tossed\nhither and thither, a glove blown here and there by\nthe wind like a reed. This is no longer the case.\nI'm correct in saying it isnot. Man has determined to\nrebel ; it is a bloodless rebellion, though, and very\ndifferent to the revolutions which dishonourable\ntraitors to their country have now and again stirred\nup against their lawful rulers. No! gentlemen!\nI\u2019m speaking of a revolution against nature! Man\nhas declared war to the natural forces; he has said,\n\u2018Thus far shalt thou go and no farther !\u2019 \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cHear ! hear !\u2019\u2019 and clapping of hands.\n\n\u201cThe merchant sends out his steamer, his brig, his\n", "schooner, his barge, his yacht, and so forth. The gale\nbreaks the vessel to pieces. \u2018 Break away !\u2019 says the\nmerchant, for he loses nothing. \u2018This is the great\naspect of the insurance idea. Imagine the position,\ngentlemen! The merehant has declared war upon\nthe storms of heaven\u2014and the merchant has won the\nday!\u201d\n\nA storm of applause brought a triumphant smile\nto the face of the great man ; he seemed thoroughly\nto enjoy this storm.\n\n\u201c* But, gentlemen, do not Iet us call an Insurance\nInstitution a business. It is not a business; we are\nnot business men. Far from it! We have collected\na sum of money and we are ready to risk it. Is this\nnot so, gentlemen ? \u201d\n\n** Yes, yes!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c We have collected a sum of money so as to have\nit ready to hand over to him whom misfortune has\nbefallen; his pereentage\u2014I think he pays 1 per\neent.\u2014cannot be called a contribution ; it is called\na premium, and rightly so. Not that we want any\nsort of reward\u2014premium means reward\u2014for our\nlittle services, which we merely render beeause we\nare interested\u2014as far as I am concerned it is purely\nfor this reason. I repeat, I don\u2019t think\u2014there can\nbe any question that any one in our midst would\nhesitate\u2014I don\u2019t think that one of us would mind\nseeing his contribution, if I may be allowed to call\nthe shares by that name, used for the furtherance\nof the idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! No!\u201d\n\n\u201cJT will now ask the Managing Director to read\nthe annual report.\u201d\n\nThe director rose. He looked as pale as if he had\nbeen through a storm; his big cuffs with the onyx\nstuds could hardly hide the slight trembling of his\nhand; his cunning cycs sought comfort and strength\nin Smith\u2019s bearded face ; he opened his coat and his\nexpansive shirt front swelled as if it were ready to\nreceive a shower of arrows\u2014and read :\n", "\u201cTruly, strange and unexpected are the ways of\nProvidence .. .\u201d\n\nAt the word Providence a considerable number of\nfaces blanched, but the district-marshal raised his\neyes towards the ceiling as if he were prepared for the\nworst (a loss of two hundred crowns).\n\n\u201cThe year which we have just completed will long\nstand in our annals like a cross on the grave of the\naccidents which have brought to scorn the foresight\nof the wisest and the calculations of the most cautious.\u201d\n\nThe district-marshal buried his face in his hands as\nif he were praying. Struve, believing that the white\nwall dazzled his eyes, te ape up to pull down the\nblind, but the secretary had already forestalled him.\n\nThe reader drank a glass of water. This caused an\noutburst of impatience.\n\n\u201cTo business! Figures ! \u201d\n\nThe district-marshal removed his hand from his\neyes and was taken aback when he found that it was\nso much darker than it had been before. There was\na momentary embarrassment and the storm gathered.\nAll respect was forgotten.\n\n\u201cTo business! Go on!\u201d\n\nThe director skipped the preliminary banalities, and\nplunged right into the heart of the matter.\n\n\u201cVery well, gentlemen, I will cut my speech\nshort |\u201d\n\n\u201cGoon! Goon! Why the devil don\u2019t you ?\u201d\n\nThe hammer fell. \u2018\u2018 Gentlemen!\u2019 There was so\nmuch dignity in this brief \u2018\u201c\u2018 Gentlemen \u201d that the\nassembly immediately remembered their self-respect.\n\n\u201c<The Society has been responsible during the year\nfor one hundred and sixty-nine millions.\u201d\n\n** Hear ! hear!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd has received a million and a half in pre-\nmiums.\u201d\u201d\n\n** Hear ! hear!\u201d\n\nFalk made a hasty calculation and found that if\nthe full receipts in premiums, namely, one million and\na half, and the total original capital, one million, were\n", "deducted, there remained about one hundred and\nsixty-six millions for which the society was respon-\nsible. He realized what \u201cthe ways of Providence \u201d\nmeant.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately the amount paid on policies was\none million seven hundred and twenty-eight thousand\nsix hundred and seventy crowns and eight Gre.\u201d\n\n** Shame !\u201d\u201d :\n\n* As you see, gentlemen, Providence .. .\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave Providence alone! Figures! Figures !\nDividends ! \u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the circumstances I can only propose, in\nmy capacity as Managing Director, a dividend of 5 per\ncent. on the paid-up capital.\u201d\n\nNow a storm burst out which no merchant in the\nworld could have weathered.\n\n\u201cShame! Impudenece! Swindler! Five per cent!\nDisgusting ! It\u2019s throwing one\u2019s money away ! \u201d\n\nBut there were also a few more philanthropic\nutterances, such as: \u2018* What about the poor, small\ncapitalists who have nothing but their dividends to\nlive on? How\u2019ll they manage? Merey on us, what\na misfortune! The State ought to help, and without\ndelay! Ohdear! Ohdear!\u201d\n\nWhen the storm had subsided a little and the\ndirector could make his voice heard, he read out the\nhigh praise given by the Supervisory Committee to\nthe Managing Director and all the employ\u00e9s who,\nwithout sparing themselves, and with indefatigable\nzeal, had done the thankless work. The statement\nwas received with open scorn.\n\nThe report of the accountants was then read. They\nstated\u2014after again censuring Providence\u2014that they\nhad found all the books in good\u2014not to say excellent\n\u2014order, and in checking the inventory all debentures\non the reserve fund had been found correct (!) They\ntherefore called upon the shareholders to discharge\nthe directors and acknowledge their honest and\nunremitting labour.\n\nThe directors were, of course, discharged.\n", "The Managing Director then declared that under the\ncircumstances he could not think of accepting his\nbonus (a hundred crowns) and handed it to the reserve\nfund. This declaration was received with applause\nand laughter.\n\nAfter a short evening prayer, that is to say a humble\npetition to Providence that next year\u2019s dividend\nmight be 20 per cent., the district-marshal closed the\nproceedings.\n", "CHAPTER XIII\n\nDIVINE ORDINANCE\nOn the same afternoon on which her husband had\nattended the meeting of the Marine Insurance Society\n\u2018** Triton,\u2019\u2019 Mrs. Falk for the first time wore a new blue\nvelvet dress, with which she was eager to arouse the\nenvy of Mrs. Homan, who lived in the house opposite.\nNothing was easicr or more simple ; all she had to do\nwas to show herself every now and then at the window\nwhile she supervised the preparations in her room, in-\ntended to \u201ccrush\u201d her guests, whom she expected at\nseven. \u2018The Administrative Committee of the Cr\u00e9che\n\u2018** Bethlehem \u201d was to meet and examine the first\nmonthly report ; it consisted of Mrs. Homan, whose\nhusband, the controller, Mrs, Falk suspected of pride\nbecause he wasa Government official ; Lady Rehnhjelm\nwhom she suspected of the same failing because of her\ntitle, and the Rev. Skore, who was private chaplain\nof all the great families. The whole committee was\nto be crushed and crushed in the swectest possible\nmanner.\n\nThe new setting for the scene had already been dis-\nplayed at the big party. All the old pieces which were\nneither antique nor possessed of any artistic value had\nbeen replaced by brand new furniture. Mrs. Falk\nintended to manage the actors in the little play until\nthe close of the proceedings, when her husband would\narrive upon the scene with an admiral\u2014he had\npromised his wife at least an admiral in full-dress\nuniform. Both were to crave admission to the\nsociety. Falk was to enlarge the funds of the society\non the spot by handing over to it a part of the sum\n\n146\n", "which he had been earning so easily as shareholder of\nthe \u201c\u2018 Triton.\u201d\nMrs. Falk had finished with the window and was now\n\narranging the rosewood table, inlaid with mother-of-\npearl, on which the proofs of the monthly report were\nto be laid. She dusted the agate inkstand,placed the\nsilver penholder on the tortoiseshell rack, turned up\nthe seal of the chrysoprase handle so as to hide her\ncommoner\u2019s name, cautiously shook the cash-box\nmade of the finest steel wire, so that the value of the\nfew bank-notes it contained could be plainly read.\n\nFinally, having given her last orders to the footman\n\ndressed up for the parade, she sat down in her drawing-\n\nroom in the careless attitude in which she desired that\n\nthe announcement of her friend, the controller\u2019s wife,\n\nshould discover her ; Mrs. Homan would be sure to be\nthe first to arrive.\n\nShe did arrive first. Mrs. Falk embraced Evelyn\nand kissed her on the cheek, and Mrs. Homan embraced\nEugenia, who received her in the dining-room and\nretained her there for a few moments in order to ask\nher opinion of the new furniture. Mrs. Homan wasted\nno time on the solid oak sideboard dating from the\ntime of Charles XII, with the tall Japanese vases,\nbecause she felt small by the side of it ; she looked at\nthe chandelier which she found too modern, and the\ndining-table, which, she said, was not in keeping with\nthe prevailing style ; in addition to this she considered\nthat the oleographs were out of place among the old\nfamily portraits, and took quite a long time to\nexplain the difference between an oil painting and an\noleograph. Mrs. Falk\u2019s new silk-lined velvet dress\nswished against every corner within reach without\nsucceeding in attracting her friend\u2019s attention. She\nasked her whether she liked the new Brussels carpet\nin the drawing-room; Mrs. Homan thought it con-\ntrasted too crudely with the curtains; at last Mrs.\nFalk felt annoyed with her and dropped her questions.\n\nThey sat down at the drawing-room table, clutching\nat life-buoys in the guise of photographs, unreadable\n", "volumes of verse, and so on. A little pamphlet fell\ninto Mrs. Homan\u2019s hands; it was printed on gold-\nedged pink paper and bore the title: \u2018To the wholesale\nmerehant Nicholas Falk, on his fortieth birthday.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cAh! These are the verses which were read at\nyour party! Who wrote them ?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cA very clever man, a friend of my husband\u2019s.\nHis name\u2019s Nystr\u00e9m.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hm! Tow qucer that his name should be quite\nunknown! Suchaclever man! But why wasn\u2019t he\nat your party ?\u201d\n\n** Unfortunately he was ill, my dear ; so he couldn\u2019t\ncome.\u201d\n\n\u201cTsee! But, my dear Eugenia, isn\u2019t it awfully sad\nabout your brother-in-law ? I hear he\u2019s so very badly\noff.\u201d\n\n** Don\u2019t mention him! Te\u2019s a disgrace and a grief\nto the whole family! It\u2019s terrible !\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cYes; it was quite unpleasant when everybody\nasked about him at your party. I was so sorry for\nyou, dear. . . .\u201d\n\nThis is for the oak sideboard, dating from the time\nof Charles XII. and the Japanese vases, thought the\ncontroller\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201cFor me! Oh, please don\u2019t! You mean for my\nhusband ? \u201d interrupted Mrs. Falk.\n\n\u201cSurely, that\u2019s the same thing !\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all! Ican\u2019t be held responsible for all the\nblack sheep in his family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a pity it was that your parents, also, were\nill and couldn\u2019t come! Tlow\u2019s your dear father ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks. He\u2019s quite well again. How kind of\nyou to think of everybody !\u201d\n\n** Well, one shouldn\u2019t think of oneself only! Is he\ndelicate, the old\u2014what is his title ? \u201d\n\n\u201c* Captain, if you like.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cCaptain! I was under the impression that my\nhusband said he was\u2014one of the erew of the flagship,\nbut very likely it\u2019s the same thing. But where were\nthe girls \u00a2\u201d\n", "That\u2019s for the Brussels carpet, mentally reflected\nthe controller\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201c\u201cThey are so full of whims, they can never be\ndepended on.\u201d\n\nMrs. Falk turned over the leaves in her photograph\nalbum; the binding cracked ; she was in a towering\nrage.\n\n**T say, dear, who was the disagreeable individual\nwho read the verses on the night of your party ?\u201d\n\n**' You mean Mr.-Levin; the royal secretary ; he\u2019s\nmy husband\u2019s most intimate friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he really? Hm! How strange! My hus-\nband\u2019s a controller in the same office where he\u2019s a\nsecretary ; I don\u2019t want to-vex you, or say anything\nunpleasant ; I never do; but my husband says that\nLevin\u2019s in such bad circumstances that it\u2019s not wise\nfor your husband to associate with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he? That\u2019s a matter of which I know\nnothing, and in which I don\u2019t interfere, and let me tell\nyou, my dear Evelyn, I never interfere in my husband\u2019s\nalfairs, though I\u2019ve heard of people who do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI beg your pardon, dear, I thought I was doing\nyou a service by telling you.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s for the chandelier and the dining-table.\nThere only remains the velvet dress.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d the controller\u2019s wife took up the thread\nagain, \u2018I hear that your brother-in-law. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cSpare my feelings and don\u2019t talk of the\ncreature ! \u201d\n\n\u201cIs he really such a bad lot? I\u2019ve been told that\nhe associates with the worst characters in town... .\u201d\n\nAt this juncture Mrs. Falk was repricved; the\nfootman announced Lady Rehnhjelm.\n\nOh! How welcome she was! How kind of her it\nwas to come !\n\nAnd Mrs. Falk really was pleased to see the old lady\nwith the kindly expression in her eyes ; an expression\nonly found in the eyes of those who have weathered\nthe storms of life with true courage.\n\n\u201c\u201cMy dear Mrs. Falk,\u201d said her ladyship taking a\n", "seat ; \u2018\u2018 I have all sorts of kind messages for you from\nyour brother-in-law.\u201d\n\nMrs. Falk wondered what she had done to the old\nwoman that she, too, evidently wanted to annoy her.\n\n\u201c\u201c Indeed ?\u201d she said, a little stiffly.\n\n\u201c He\u2019s a charming young man. He came to sec my\nnephew to-day, at my house ; they are great friends !\nHe really is an excellent young man! \u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t he ?\u201d\u2019 joined in Mrs. Homan, always ready\nfor a change of front. \u201c\u2018 We were just talking about\nhim.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed ? What I most admire in him is his\ncourage in venturing on a course where one easily\nruns aground ; but we need have no apprehensions\nso far as he is concerned ; he\u2019s a man of character and\nprinciple. Don\u2019t you agree with me, Mrs. Falk ?\n\n\u201cT\u2019ve always said so, but my husband thinks\ndifferently.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Your husband has always had peculiar\nviews,\u201d interposed Mrs, Homan.\n\n\u201cIs he a friend of your nephew\u2019s, Lady Rehn-\nhjclm ?\u201d asked Mrs. Falk eagerly.\n\n\u201cYes, they both belong to a small circle, some of\nthe members of which are artists. You must have\nheard about young Sell\u00e9n, whose picture was bought\nby his Majesty ?\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201c Of course, I have! We went to the Exhibition\non purpose to have a look at it. Is he one of them ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; they\u2019re often very hard up, these young\nfellows, but that\u2019s nothing new in the case of young\nmen who have to fight their way in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say your brother-in-law\u2019s a poct,\u201d\u2019 went on\nMrs. Homan.\n\n\u201cOh, rather! He writes excellent verse! The\nacademy gave him a prize; the world will hear of\nhim in time,\u201d replied Mrs. Falk with conviction.\n\n\u2018\u201c* Haven\u2019t I always said so?\u201d agreed Mr. Homan.\n\nAnd Arvid Falk\u2019s talents were enlarged upon, so\nthat he had arrived in the Temple of Fame when the\nfootman announced the Rev. Nathanael Skore. The\n", "latter entered hastily and hurriedly shook hands with\nthe ladies.\n\n\u201cT must ask your indulgence for being so late,\u201d\u2019 he\nsaid, \u201c\u2018 but I\u2019m a very busy man. I have to be at a\nmeeting at Countess Fabelkrantz\u2019s at half-past nine,\nand I have come straight from my work.\u201d\n\n** Are you in a hurry then, dear pastor ?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c Yes, my wide activities give me no leisure.\nHadn\u2019t we better begin business at once ?\u201d\n\nThe footman handed round refreshments.\n\n*\u201cWon\u2019t you take a cup of tea, pastor, before we\nbegin ?\u201d\u2019 asked the hostess, smarting under the\nSegara of a smal] disappointment.\n\nThe pastor glanced at the tray.\n\n\u201cThank you, no; I'll take a glass of punch, if I\nmay. I\u2019ve made it a rule, ladies, never to differ\nfrom my fellow-creatures in externals. Everybody\ndrinks punch; I don\u2019t like it, but I don\u2019t want the\nworld to say that I\u2019m better than anybody clse ;\nboasting is a failing which I detest. May I now\nbegin with the proceedings ? \u201d\n\nHe sat down at the writing-table, dipped the pen\ninto the ink and read :\n\n\u201c** Account of the Presents received by the Admini-\nstrative Committee of the Cr\u00e9che \u2018 Bethlehem \u201d\u2019\nduring the month of May: Signed Eugenia Falk.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201c N\u00e9e, if I may ask ?\u201d\n\n** Oh, never mind about that,\u201d said Mrs. Falk.\n\n\u201c Evelyn Homan.\u201d\n\n\u201d N\u00e9e, if I may make so bold ? \u201d\n\n\u201cVon Bahr, dear pastor.\u201d\n\n\u201c* Antoinette Rehnhjelm.\u201d\n\n\u201c* N\u00e9e, madame ?\u201d\n\n\u201c* Rehnhjelm, pastor.\u201d\n\n**Ah! true! You married your cousin, husband\ndead, no children. But to continue: Presents... .\u201d\n\nThere was a general\u2014almost general\u2014conster-\nnation.\n\n\u201c But won\u2019t you sign, too, pastor ?\u201d\u2019 asked Mrs.\nHoman.\n", "\u201cT dislike boasting, ladies, but if it\u2019s your wish !\nHere gocs!\u201d\n\n\u201c* Nathanael Skore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour health, pastor! Won't you drink a glass of\npunch before we begin ?\u201d asked the hostess with a\ncharming smile, which died on her lips when she looked\nat the pastor\u2019s glass. It was empty; she quickly\nfilled it.\n\n\u201cThank you, Mrs. Falk, but we mustn\u2019t be immode-\nrate! May I begin now? Please check me by the\nmanuscript.\u201d\n\n\u201c* Presents: H.M. the Queen, forty crowns.\nCountess Fabelkrantz, five crowns and a pair of\nwoollen stockings. Wholesale merchant Schalin, two\ncrowns, a packet of envelopes, six steel nibs, and a\nbottle of ink. Miss Amanda Libert, a bottle of eau-de-\nCologne. Miss Anna Feif, a pair of cuffs. Charlie,\ntwo-pence halfpenny from his money box. Johanna\nPettersson, half-dozen towels. Miss Emily Bj\u00e9rn, a\nNew Testament. Grocer Persson, a bag of oatmeal,\na quart of potatoes, and a bottle of pickled onions.\nDraper Scheike, two pairs of woollen under. . . .\u201d\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* May I ask the meeting whether all this is to be\nprinted ?\u201d\u2019 interrupted her ladyship.\n\n** Well, of course,\u2019\u201d\u2019 answered the pastor.\n\n\u201cThen I must resign my post on the Administrative\nCommittee.\u201d\n\n** But do you imagine, Lady Rehnhjelm, that the\nsociety could exist on voluntary contributions if the\nnames of the donors did not appear in print ?\nImpossible ! \u201d\u201d\n\n\u201c Is charity to shed its radiance on petty vanity ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no! Don\u2019t say that! Vanity is an evil,\ncertainly ; we turn the evil into good by transforming\nit into charity. Isn\u2019t that praiseworthy ?\u201d\n\n\u2018**Oh, yes! But we mustn\u2019t call petty things by\nhigh-sounding names. If we do, we are boastful ! \u201d\n\n\u201cYou are very severe, Lady Rehnhjelm ! Seripture\nexhorts us to pardon others ; you should pardon their\nvanity.\u201d\n", "\u201cI\u2019m ready to pardon it in others but not in myself.\nIt\u2019s pardonable and good that ladies who have nothing\nelse to do should find pleasure in charity ; but it\u2019s\ndisgraceful if they call it a good action seeing that it\nis only their pleasure and a greater pleasure than most\nothers on account of the wide publicity given to it by\nprinting.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d began Mrs. Falk, with the full force of her\nterrible logic, \u201c\u2018 do you mean to say that doing good is\ndisgraceful, Lady Rehnhjelm ? \u201d\n\n\u201cNo, my dear; but in my opinion it is disgraceful\nto print the fact that one has given a pair of woollen\nstockings. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cBut to give a pair of woollen stockings is doing\ngood; therefore it must be disgraceful to do\ngood... .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but to have it printed, my child! You aren\u2019t\nlistening to what I\u2019m saying,\u201d\u2019 replied her ladyship,\nreproving her stubborn hostess who would not give\nin, but went on:\n\n\u201cJT see! It\u2019s the printing which is disgraceful !\nBut the Bible is printed, consequently it is disgraceful\nto print the Bible. . . .\u201d\n\n** Please go on, pastor,\u201d interrupted her ladyship,\na little annoyed by the tactless manner in which her\nhostess defended her inanities; but the latter did\nnot yet count the battle as lost.\n\n\u201cDo you think it beneath your dignity, Lady\nRehnhjelm, to exchange views with so unimportant a\nperson asIlam...?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cNo, my child; but keep your views to yourself ;\nI don\u2019t want to exchange.\u201d\n\n** Do you call this discussing a question, may I ask ?\nWon\u2019t you enlighten us on the point, pastor? Can it\nbe called discussing a question if one party refuses to\nreply to the argument of the other ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it can\u2019t, my dear Mrs. Falk,\u201d replied\nthe pastor, with an ambiguous smile, which nearly\nreduced Mrs. Falk to tears. \u201c\u2018 But don\u2019t let us spoil a\nsplendid enterprise by quarrelling over trifles, ladies !\n", "We'll postpone the printing until the funds are larger.\nWe have scen the young enterprise shooting up like\na seed and we have seen that powerful hands are\nwilling to tend the young plant; but we must think\nof the future. The Society has a fund ; the fund must\nbe administered; in other words, we must look\nround for an administrator, a practical man, able\nto transform these presents into hard cash ; we must\nelect a treasurer. I\u2019m afraid we shall not find one\nwithout a sacrifice of money\u2014does one ever get\nanything without such a sacrifice? Have the ladies\nanybody in view ?\u201d\n\nNo, the ladies had not thought of it.\n\n\u201cThen may I propose a young man of steady\ncharacter, who in my opinion is just the right person\nfor the work? Has the Administrative Committee\nany objection to appointing secretary Ekelund to the\npost of treasurer at a suitable salary ?\u201d\n\nThe ladies had no objection to make, especially as\nthe young man was recommended by the Kev.\nNathanacl Skore; and the Pastor felt the more\nqualified to recommend him because he was a near\nrelative of his. And so the Cr\u00e9che had a treasurer\nwith a salary of six hundred crowns.\n\n** Ladies,\u2019\u2019 began the pastor again, \u201c\u2018 have we worked\nlong cnough in the vineyard for one day ?\u201d\u2019\n\nThere was silence. Mrs. Falk stared at the door\nwondering where her husband was.\n\n** My time\u2019s short and I\u2019m prevented from staying\nany longer. Flas anybody any further suggestion\nto make? No! In calling down the blessing of the\nLord on our enterprise, which has begun so auspi-\nciously, I commend all of us to His loving mercy ;\nI cannot do it in a better way than by repeating the\nwords which He Himself has taught us when He\nprayed: \u2018Abba, Father\u2014Our Father... .\u2019 \u201d\n\nHe was silent as if he were afraid of the sound of his\nown voice, and the Committee covered their faces\nwith their hands as if they were ashamed of looking\neach other in the eyes. The ensuing pause grew long,\n", "unbearably long; yet no one dared to break it ;\nevery one looked through the fingers hoping that\nsomeone else would make the first move, when a\nviolent pull at the front door bell brought the party\ndown to earth. \u2018\n\nThe pastor took his hat and emptied his glass ;\nthere was something about him of a man who is\ntrying to steal away. Mrs. Falk beamed, for here was\nthe crushing, the vengeance, the rehabilitation.\n\nRevenge was there and the crushing too, for the\nfootman handed her a letter from her husband which\ncontained\u2014the guests were not enlightened as to its\ncontents, but they saw enough to make them declare\nat once that they had pressing engagements.\n\nLady Rehnhjelm would have liked to stay and\ncomfort her young hostess, whose appearance betrayed\na high degree of consternation and unhappiness. The\nlatter, however, did not encourage her, but on the\ncontrary was so exceedingly eager to help her visitors\nwith their hats and cloaks that it looked as if she\nwanted to be rid of them as quickly as possible.\n\nThey parted in great embarrassment. The foot-\nsteps died away on the staircase and the departing\nguests could tell from the nervous haste with which\nthe hostess shut the door behind them that she longed\nfor solitude in order to be able to give vent to her\nfeelings.\n\nIt was quite true. Left by herself in the large\nrooms Mrs. Falk burst into violent sobs; but her\ntears were not the tears which fall like a May shower\non a wizened old heart ; they were the tears of wrath\nand rage which darken the mirror of the soul and fall\n\u2014 an acid on the roses of health and youth and wither\nthem.\n", "CHAPTER XIV\nABSINTH\n\nA nor afternoon sun was scorching the pavements of\nthe provincial town X-k\u00e9ping. \u2014_,v\n\n' The large vaults of the town hall'were still deserted ;\nfir branches were scattered all over the floor, and it\nsmelt of a funeral. The graduated liqueur bottles\nstood on the shelves, having an afternoon nap,\nopposite the brandy bottles which wore the collars of\ntheir orders round their necks and were on leave until\nthe evening ; the clock, which could never take a nap,\nstood against the wall like a tall peasant, whiling away\nthe time by contemplating, apparently, a huge play-\nbill, impaled on a clothes peg close by. The vault\nwas very long and narrow; both of the long walls\nwere furnished with birehwood tables, jutting out\nfrom the wall, giving it the appearance of a stable, in\nwhich the four-legged tables represented the horses\ntied with their heads to the wall and turning their\nhind quarters towards the room; at the present\nmoment all of them were asleep ; one of them lifted\nits hind leg a little off the ground, for the floor was\nvery uneven. One could see that they were \u2018fast\nasleep, for the flies were calmly walking up and down\ntheir backs.\n\nThe sixteen-year-old waiter who was leaning against\nthe tall clock close to the poster was not asleep ; he\nwas incessantly waving his white apron at the flies\nwhich had just finished their dinner in the kitchen\nand were now playing about the vaults. Every now\nand then he leaned back and put his ear to the chest\nof the clock, as if he were sounding it, or wanting to\n\n156\n", "find out what it had had for dinner. He was soon to\nbe enlightened. The tall creature gave a sob, and\nexactly four minutes later it sobbed again ; a groaning\nand rumbling in its inside made the lad jump;\nrattling terribly it struck six times, after which it\ncontinued its silent work.\n\nThe boy, too, began to work. He walked round his\nstable, grooming his horses with his apron and putting\neverything in order as if he were expecting visitors.\nOn one of the tables, in the background, from which a\nspectator could view the whole long room, he placed\nmatches, a bottle of absinth and two glasses, a liqueur\nglass and a tumbler; then he fetched a bottle of\nwater from the pump and put it on the table by the\nside of the a iemiaiibles: When everything was\nready, he paced up and down the room, occasionally\nstriking quite unexpected attitudes, as if he were\nimitating somebody. Now he stood with arms folded\nacross his chest, his head bowed, staring fiercely at the\nfaded paper on the old walls ; now he stood with legs\ncrossed, the knuckles of his right hand touching the\nedge of the table holding in his left a lorgnette, made\nof a piece of wire from a beer bottle through which he\nsarcastically scanned the mouldings on the ceiling.\n\nThe door flew open, and a man of thirty-five entered\nwith assurance, as if he were coming into his own\nhouse. His beardless face had the sharply cut\nfeatures which are the result of much exercise of the\nfacial muscles, characteristic of actors and one other\nclass. Every muscle and ligament was plainly visible\nunder the skin with its bluish shadows on upper lip\nand chin, but the miserable wire-work which set these\nfine tangents in motion was invisible, for he was not\nlike a common ari which requires a pedal. A high,\nrather narrow forehead with hollow temples, rose like\na true Corinthian capital; black, untidy locks of\nhair climbed round it like wild creepers, from which\nsmall straight snakes darted, trying to reach the\nsockets of his eyes, but ever failing to do so. In calm\nmoments his large, dark eyes looked gentle and sad,\n", "but there were times when they blazed and then the\npupils looked like the muzzles of a revolver.\n\nHe took his seat at the table which the boy had\nprepared and looked sadly at the water bottle.\n\n\u201cWhy do you always give me a bottle of water,\nGustav ?\u201d\n\n**So that you won\u2019t be burned to death, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201c* What does it matter to you whether I am or not ?\nCan\u2019t I burn if I like ?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be a nihilist to-day, sir.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* Nihilist ? Who talked to you of nihilists ?\nWhen did you hear that word? Are you mad, boy ?\nSpeak !\u201d\n\nHe rose to his feet and fired a few shots from his\ndark revolvers.\n\nFear and consternation at the expression in the\nactor\u2019s face kept Gustav tongue tied.\n\n\u201c* Answer, boy, when did you hear this word ? \u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cMr. Montanus said it a few days ago, when he\ncame here from his church,\u201d answered the boy timidly.\n\n\u2018*Montanus, indeed!\u201d said the melancholy man,\nsitting down again. \u2018* Montanus is my man: he has\na large understanding. I say, Gustav, what\u2019s the\nname, I mean the nickname, by which these theatrical\nblackguards call me? Tell me! You necdn\u2019t be\n\nafraid.\u201d\n\n** Td rather not, sir; it\u2019s very ugly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not if you can please me by doing so ?\nDon\u2019t you think I could do with a little cheering up ?\nDo I look so frightfully gay ?

Hm! I suppose you tell them that their\njokes are stale ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes; everything they say is stale; they are so\nstale themselves that they make me sick.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed! And don\u2019t you think that being a\nwaiter is stale ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Ido; life and death and everything is an old\nstory\u2014no\u2014to be an actor would be something new.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, my friend.

The\nrays of the sun fell through the window, passing\nthrough the sieve of the great aspens outside, whose\nlight foliage, dancing in the evening breeze, threw a\ntremulous net on the long wall. The shadow of the\nmelancholy man\u2019s head, with its untidy locks of hair,\nfell on the lowest corner of the nct and looked very\nmuch like a huge spider.\n\nGustav had returned to the clock, where he sat\nplunged in nihilistic silence, watching the flies dancing\nround the hanging lamp.\n\n\u201c* Gustav ! ? came a voice from the spider\u2019s web.\n\n\u201cYes sir!\u201d was the prompt response from the\nclock.\n\n\u201c* Are your parents still alive ? \u201d\u2019\n\n*\u201c No, sir, you know they aren\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201c* Good for you.\u201d\n\nA long pause.\n\n\u201c Gustav !\u201d\n\nTes sit!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you sleep at night ? \u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean, sir?\u201d answered Gustav\nblushing. ,\n", "\u201cWhat I say!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I can!

Well, then, this\ndesire of yours is so strong, that you would: rather\nsuffer want, humiliate yourself, allow yourself to be\nsucked dry by vampires, lose your social reputation,\nbecome bankrupt, go to the dogs\u2014than turn back.\nAm I right ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! How well you know me!\u201d\n\n\u201cTI once knew a young man\u2014I know him no\nlonger, he is so changed! He was fifteen years old\nwhen he left the penitentiary which every community\nkeeps for the children who commit the outrageous\ncrime of being born, and where the innocent little\nones are made to atone for their parents\u2019 fall from\ngrace\u2014for what should otherwise become of society ?\nPlease remind me to keep to the subject !_ On leaving\nit he went for five years to Upsala and read a terrible\nnumber of books; his brain was divided into six\npigeon-holes in which six kinds of information, dates,\nnames, a whole warehouseful of ready-made opinions,\nconclusions, theories, ideas and nonsense of every\ndescription, were stored like a general cargo. \u2018This\nmight have been allowed to pass, for there\u2019s plenty\nof room in a brain. But he was also supposed to\naccept foreign thoughts, rotten, old thoughts, which\n\nL\na\n", "others had chewed for a lifetime, and which they now\nvomited. It filled him with nausea and\u2014he was\ntwenty years old\u2014he went on thestage. Look at my\nwatch! Look at the second-hand; it makes sixty\nlittle steps before a minute has passed; sixty times\nsixty before it is an hour; twenty-four times the\nnumber and it is a day ; three hundred and sixty-five\ntimes and it is only a year. Now imagine ten years !\nDid you ever wait for a friend outside his house ?\nThe first quarter of an hour passes like a flash! \u2018The\nsecond quarter\u2014oh ! one doesn\u2019t mind waiting for a\nperson one\u2019s fond of; the third quarter: he\u2019s not\ncoming; the fourth: hope and fear; the fifth: one\ngoes away but hurries back ; the sixth: Damn it all!\nI\u2019ve wasted my time for nothing! the seventh:\nhaving waited so long, I might just as well wait a little\nlonger ; the eighth: raging and cursing ; the ninth:\nOne goes home, lies down on one\u2019s sofa and feels as\ncalm as if one were walking arm in arm with death.\nHe waited for ten years! \u2018len years! Isn\u2019t my hair\nstanding on end when I say ten years ? Look at it!\nTen years had passed before he was allowed to play a\npart. When he did, he had a tremendous suecess\u2014at\nonce. But his ten wasted years had brought him to\nthe verge of insanity; he was mad that it hadn\u2019t\nhappened ten years before. And he was amazed to\nfind that happiness when at last he held it within his\ngrasp didn\u2019t make him happy! And so he was un-\nhappy.\u201d\n\n** But don\u2019t you think he required the ten years for\nthe study of his art ?\u201d\n\n** How could he study it when he was never allowed\nto play ? He was a laughing-stock, the seum of the\nplaybill ; the management said he was no good ; and\nwhenever he tried to find an engagement at another\ntheatre, he was told that he had no repertoire.\u201d\n\n*\u201c But why couldn\u2019t he be happy when his luck had\nturned ?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think an immortal soul is content with\nhappiness? But why speak about it? Your resolu-\n", "tion is irrevocable.

He was a man of\nabout fifty, with a huge, heavy head, fixed between\na pair of lumpy shoulders like a mortar on a gun\ncarriage, with a permanent elevation of forty-five\ndegrees, looking as if it were going to throw bombs at\nthe stars. To judge from the faee, the owner was\ncapable of all possible crimes and impossible vices, but\ntoo great a coward to commit any. He immediately\nthrew a bombshell at the melancholy man, and\nharshly ordered a glass of grog made of rum, in\ngrammatical, uncouth language and in the voice of a\ncorporal.\n\n*'This is the man who holds your fate in his hands,\u201d\nwhispered the melancholy man to Rehnhjelm. \u201c This\nis the tragedian, actor-manager, and my deadly foe.\u201d\n\nRehnhjelm could not suppress a shudder of disgust\nas le looked at the terrible individual who, after\n", "having exchanged a look of hatred with Falander, now\nclosed the passage of arms by repeated expectorations. ,\n\nThe door opened again, and in\u2019glided the almost \\\nelegant figure of a middle-aged man with oily hair\nand.a waxed moustache. He familiarly took his\nplace by the side of the actor-manager, who gave him\nhis middle finger on which shone a ring with a large\ncornelian.\n\n\u201cThis is the editor of the Conservative paper, the\ndefender of throne and altar. He has the run of the\ntheatre and tries to seduce all the girls on whom the\nactor-manager hasn\u2019t cast his eye. He started his\ncareer as a Government official, but had to resign his\npost, I\u2019m ashamed to tell you why,\u201d explained\nFalander. \u2018\u2018 But Iam also ashamed to remain in the\nsame room with these gentlemen, and, moreover, I\nhave asked a few friends here, to-night, to a little\nsupper in celebration of my recent benefit. If you\ncare to spend the evening in bad company, among the\nmost unimportant actors, two notorious ladies and an\nold blackguard, you are welcome at eight.\u201d\n\nRehnhjelm hesitated a moment before he accepted\nthe invitation.\n\nThe spider on the wall climbed through his net as if\nto examine it and disappeared.

Memories of the previous\nnight arose like phantoms and crowded round him.\n\nHe saw again the pretty, closely shuttered room,\nrichly decorated with flowers, in which the orgy\nhad been held. He saw the actress, a lady of thirty-\nfive who, thanks to a younger rival, had to play the\nparts of old women; he saw her entering the room,\nin a frenzy of rage and despair at the fresh humilia-\ntions heaped upon her, throwing herself full length\non the sofa, drinking glass after glass of wine and,\nwhen the temperature of the room rose, opening her\nbodice, as a man opens his waistcoat after a too-\nplentiful dinner.\n\nHe saw again the old comedian who, after a very\nshort career, had been degraded from playing lead\nto taking servant\u2019s parts; he now entertained the\ntradespeople of the town with his songs, and, above\nall, with the stories of his short glory.\n\nBut, in the very heart of the clouds of smoke and\nhis drunken visions Rehnhjelm saw the picture of a\nyoung girl of sixteen, who had arrived with tears in\nher eyes, and told the melancholy Falander that the\ngreat actor-manager had again been persecuting her\nwith insulting proposals, vowing that in future, unless\nshe would accede to them, she should play only the\nvery smallest parts.\n\nAnd he saw Falander, listening to everybody\u2019s\ntroubles and complaints, breathing on them until\nthey vanished; he watched him, reducing insults,\n\n169\n", "humiliations, kicks, accidents, want, miscry, and\ngrief to nothing ; watched him teaching his friends\nand warning them never to, exaggerate anything,\nleast of all their troubles. a\n\nBut again and again his thoughts reverted to the\nlittle girl of sixteen with the innocent face, with whom\nhe had made friends, and who had kissed him when\nthey parted, hungrily, passionately. To be quite\ncandid, her kiss had taken him by surprise. But\nwhat was her name ?\n\nHe rose, and stretching out his hand for the water-\nbottle, he seized a tiny handkerchief, spotted with\nwine. Ah! Here was her name, _ ineffaceable,\nwritten in marking ink\u2014Agnes! He kissed the hand-\nkerchief twice on the cleanest spot and put it into\nhis box,\n\nWhen he had carefully dressed himself, he went\nout to see the actor-manager, whom he confidently\nexpected to find at the theatre between twelve and\nthree.\n\nTo be on the safe side, he arrived at the office at\ntwelve o\u2019clock ; he found no one there but a porter,\nwho asked him what he wanted and put himself at\nhis service.\n\nRehnhjelm did not think that he would need his\nhelp, and asked to see the actor-manager ; he was\ntold that the actor-manager was at the present\nmoment at the factory, but would no doubt come to\nthe office in the course of the afternoon.\n\nRehnhjelm supposed factory to be a slang expres-\nsion for theatre, but the porter explained to him that\nthe actor-manager was also a match manufacturer.\nHis brother-in-law, the cashier, was a post office\nemploy\u00e9 and never came to the theatre before two\no\u2019clock ; his son, the seerctary, had a post in the\ntelegraph office, and his presence could never be\nsafely relied upon. But the porter, who seemed to\nguess the object of Rehnhjelm\u2019s visit, handed him,\non his own responsibility and in the name of the\ntheatre, a copy of the statutes ; the young gentleman\n", "was at liberty to amuse himself with it until one of\nthe managerial staff arrived.\n\nRehnhjelm possessed his soul in patience and sat\ndown on the sofa to study the documents. It was\nhalf-past twelve when he had finished reading them.\nHe talked to the porter until a quarter to one, and\nthen set himself to fathom the meaning of para-\ngraph 1 of the statutes. \u2018\u2018 The theatre is a moral\ninstitution,\u201d it ran, \u2018 therefore the members of the\ncompany should endeavour to live in the fear of God,\nand to lead a virtuous and moral life.\u201d\u201d He turned\nand twisted the sentence about, trying to throw light\nupon it, without succeeding. \u2018If the theatre is a\nmoral institution,\u2019\u2019 he mused, \u2018\u2018 the members who\u2014\nin addition to the manager, the cashier, the secretary,\nthe machinists, and scene-shifters\u2014form the institu-\ntion, need not endeavour to practise all these beautiful\nthings. If it said: The theatre is an immoral\ninstitution and therefore . . . there would be some\nsense init ; but that, surely, the management does not\nintend to convey.\u201d\n\nHe thought of Hamlet\u2019s \u2018\u201c words, words,\u201d but\nimmediately remembered that to quote Hamlet was\nstale, and that one ought to clothe one\u2019s thoughts in\none\u2019s own words; he chose his own term, and called\nthe regulations nonsense, but discarded the expression\nagain, because it was not original; but then the\noriginal was not original either.\n\nParagraph 2 helped him to while away a quarter\nof an hour in meditation on the text: \u2018\u201c The theatre\nis not a place for amusement; it does not merely\nexist to give pleasure.\u201d In one place it said the\ntheatre is not a place for amusement and in another\nthe theatre does not \u201c merely \u201d exist to give pleasure,\ntherefore it did exist to give pleasure\u2014to a certain\nextent.\n\nHe reflected under what circumstances the theatre\nministered to one\u2019s pleasure. It was amusing to see\nchildren, especially sons, defrauding their parents,\nmore particularly when the parents were thrifty, good-\n", "hearted, and sensible; it was amusing to see wives\ndeceiving their husbands; especially when the |\nhusband was old and required his wife\u2019s care. Besides\nthis he remembered having laughed very heartily\nat two old men who nearly died of starvation because\ntheir business was on the decline, and that to this\nday all the world Jaughed at it in a piece written by\na classical author. He also recollected having been\nmuch amused by the misfortune of an elderly man\nwho had become deaf; and that, together with six\nhundred other men and women, he had shouted with\nlaughter at a priest, who tried, by natural means, to\ncure his insanity, the result of self-restraint ; his\nmirth had been particularly stimulated by the\nhypocrisy displayed 4 the wily pricst in order to\ngain the object of his desire.\n\nWhy does one laugh? he wondered. And as he\nhad nothing else to do, he tried to find an answer.\nOne laughed at misfortune, want, misery, vice, virtue,\nthe defeat of good, the victory of evil.\n\nThis conelusion, which was partly new to him, put\nhim into a good temper; he found a great deal of\namusement in playing with his thoughts. As the\nmanagement still remained invisible, he went on\nplaying, and, before the lapse of five minutes, he had\ncome to the following conclusion: In a tragedy one\nweeps at just those things which in comedy make one\nlaugh.\n\nAt this point his thoughts were arrested ; the great\nactor-manager burst into the room, brushed past\nRehnhjelm without apparently being aware of his\npresence and entered a room on the left, whither, a\nmoment afterwards, the violent ringing of a bell\nsummoned the porter. In less than half a minute he\nhad gone in and come out again, announcing that\nhis Highness was ready to receive the visitor.\n\nAs Rehnhjelm entered the director had already\nfired his shot and his mortar was fixed at an angle\nwhich quite prevented him from perceiving the\nnervous mortal who was timidly coming into the\n", "room. But he had no doubt heard him, for he asked\nhim immediately, in an offensive manner, what he\nwanted.\n\nRehnhjelm stammered that he was anxious to\nmake his d\u00e9but on the stage.\n\n\u201cWhat? A d\u00e9but? Have you a_ repertory,\nsir? Have you played \u2018 Hamlet,\u2019 \u2018 Lear,\u2019 \u2018 Richard\nSheridan\u2019; been called ten times before the curtain\nafter the third act ?. What ?\u201d\n\n\u201c*T\u2019ve never played a part.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Isee! That\u2019s quite another thing ! \u201d\n\nHe sat down in an easy-chair painted with silver\npaint and covered with blue brocade. His face had\nbecome a mask. He might have been sitting for a\nportrait for one of the biographies of Suetonius.\n\n\u201cShall I give you my candid opinion, what ?\nLeave the theatrical profession alone ! \u201d\n\n\u201c* Impossible ! \u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT repeat, leave it alone! It\u2019s the worst of all\nprofessions! Full of humiliations, unpleasantnesses,\nlittle annoyances, and thorns which will embitter\nyour life so that you\u2019ll wish you had never been born.\u201d\n\nHe looked as if he were speaking the truth, but\nRehnhjelm\u2019s resolution was not to be shaken.\n\n\u201c*T beg you to take my advice! I solemnly adjure\nyou to drop this idea. I tell you that the prospects\nare so bad, that for years to come you'll have simply\nto walk on. Think of it! And don\u2019t come to me\nwith complaints when it is too late. The theatrical\ncareer is so infernally difficult, sir, that you would not\ndream of taking it up, if you had the least knowledge\nof it! It\u2019s a hell! believe me. I have spoken.\u201d\n\nIt was a waste of breath.\n\n** Well, wouldn\u2019t you prefer an engagement without\na d\u00e9but ? The risk is less great.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT shall be only too pleased; I never expected\nmore.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you\u2019d better sign this agreement. A salary\nof twelve hundred crowns and a two years\u2019 engage-\nment. Do you agree ?\u201d\n", "He pulled a filled-up agreement, signed by the\nmanagement, from underneath the blotting-pad, and\ngave it to Rehnhjelm. The latter\u2019s brain was\nwhirling at the thought of the twelve hundred crowns\nand he signed it without a look at the contents.\n\nWhen he had signed the actor-manager held out\nhis large middle finger with the cornelian ring, and\nsaid: \u201c\u2018 Be welcome!\u2019 He flashed at him with the\ngums of his upper jaw and the yellow and bloodshot\nwhites of his eyes with their green irises.\n\n\u2018The audience was over. But Rehnhjelm\u2014in whose\nopinion the whole business had been hurried through\nfar too quickly\u2014instead of moving, took the liberty\nof asking whether he had not better wait until all the\nmembers of the management were assembled.\n\n\u201clhe management ? \u201d\u2019 shouted the great tragedian.\n\u201cTam the management. If you have any questions\nto ask, address yourself to me! If you want advice,\ncome tome! \u2018lo me, sir! \u2018To nobody else! \u2018That\u2019s\nall! You can go now!\u201d\n\nThe skirt of Rehnhjelm\u2019s coat must have caught on\na nail, for he turned on the threshold to see what the\nlast words looked like ; but he saw only the red gums,\nwhich had the appearance of an instrument of torture,\nand the bloodshot eyes; he felt no desire to ask for\nan explanation, but went straight to the vaults\nof the town hall\u2019 to have some dinner and meet\nValander. ~ a\n\nFalander was sitting at one of the tables, calm and\nindifferent, as if he were prepared for the worst. He\nwas not surprised to hear that Rehnhjelm had been\nengaged, although this news considerably inereased\nhis gloom.\n\n\u201cAnd what did you think of the manager ?\u201d\u2019 he\nasked.\n\n*T wanted to box his cars, but I hadn\u2019t the\ncourage.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c Nor has the management, and therefore he rules\nautocratically\u2014brutality always rules! Perhaps you\nknow that he is a playwright as well as all the rest ? \u201d\n\n'S dace Wallere 4 |\n", "** I\u2019ve heard about it.\u201d\n\n\u201c* He writes a sort of historical play which is always\nsuccessful. The reason is that he writes parts instead\nof creating characters ; he manipulates the applause\nat the exits and trades on so-called patriotism. His\ncharacters never talk, they quarrel ; men and women,\nold and young, all of them; for this reason his\npopular piece, The Sons of King Gustavus, is\nrightly called a historical quarrel in five acts; it\ncontains no action, nothing but quarrels : family rows,\nstreet brawls, -scenes in Parliament, and so on.\nQuestions are answered by sly cuts, which do not\nprovoke scenes, but the most terrible scuffles. There\nis no dialogue, nothing but squabbling, in which the\ncharacters insult each other, and the highest dramatic\neffect is attained by blows. The critics call his\ncharacterisation great. What has he made of\nGustavus Vasa in the play I just mentioned? A\nbroad-shouldered, long-bearded, bragging, untenable\nfellow of enormous strength; at the meeting of\nParliament at Vasteros, he breaks a table with his\nfist, and at Vadstena he kicks a door panel to pieces,\nOn one occasion however the critics said there was\nno meaning in his plays; it made him angry, and\nhe resolved to write comedies with plenty of meaning.\nHe had a boy at school\u2014the blackguard\u2019s married\u2014\nwho had been playing pranks and got a thrashing.\nImmediately his father wrote a comedy in which he\ndrew the masters and exposed the inhuman treat-\nment boys receive at school in these days. On\nanother occasion he was criticized by an honest\nreviewer, and immediately he wrote a comedy,\nlibelling the liberal journalists of the town. But\nI'll say no more about him ! \u201d\n\n\u201cWhy does he hate you ? \u201d\n\n\u2018* Because I said, at a rehearsal, Don Pasquale, in\nspite of his maintaining that the proper pronuncia-\ntion was Pascal. Result : I was ordered, on penalty\nof a fine, to pronounce the word in his way. It was\nimmaterial to him, he said, how the rest of the world\n", "pronounced the word, at X-h\u00e9ping it was to be\npronounced Pascal, because it was his wish.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere does he come from? What was he\nbefore ? \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c\u201cCan\u2019t you guess that he was a wheelwright ?\nHe'd poison you if he thought you knew it. But let\nus change the subject ; how do you feel after last\nnight\u2019s revels ? \u201d\n\n\u201cSplendid! I quite forgot to thank you!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cDon\u2019t mention it!

You're in love\nwith each other! If you\u2019re agreed, only the most\nprivate detail is wanting.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT don\u2019t understand what you mean! Are you\ntrying to encourage me to behave like a scoundrel\ntowards her ? \u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cT am trying to encourage you to obey the great\nvoice of nature and snap your fingers at the petty\ncommands of men. It\u2019s only envy if men condemn\nyour conduct; their much-talked-of morality is\nnothing but malice, in a suitable, presentable guise.\nTfasn\u2019t nature called you for some time to her great\nbanquet, the delight of the gods and the horror of\nsocicty afraid of having to pay alimony ? \u201d\n\n\u2018* Why don\u2019t you advise me to marry her ?\u201d\n\n\u2018* Because that\u2019s quite another thing! One doesn\u2019t\nbind oneself for life after having spent one evening\ntogether ; it doesn\u2019t follow that he who has enjoyed\nthe rapture, must also undergo the pain. Matrimony\nis an affair of souls; there can be no question of\nthis in your case. However, there\u2019s no need for me\nto spur you on; the inevitable is bound to happen.\n", "Love each other while you\u2019re young, before it\u2019s too\nlate ; love each other as birds love, without worrying\nabout how to furnish a home; love as the flowers\nof the species Dicecia.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018You\u2019ve no right to talk disrespectfully of the\ngirl.

She is worthy of a\ngreat and pure love, not merely of the passion you\nspeak of. Don\u2019t ever talk to me about her in this\nway again.

Good-bye, good luck ! \u201d\n\nAnd he left Rehnhjelm to his dinner and his\nreflections.\n\nWhen Falander arrived home, he put on a dressing-\ngown and slippers, as if he were expecting no visitors.\n\nM\n", "But he seemed full of an uncontrollable restlessness.\nIle walked up and down the room, stopping every\nnow and then at the window and gazing at the strect\nfrom behind thecurtain. Aftera while he stopped before\nthe looking-glass, took his collar off and laid it on\nthe sofa table. For a few more minutes he continued\nhis promenade, but suddenly, coming to a standstill\nbefore a card-tray, he took up the photograph of a\nlady, placed it under a strong magnifying glass and\nexamined it as if it were a mieroscopie slide. He\nlingered a long time over his examination.\n\nPresently he heard the sound of footsteps on the\nstairs; quickly concealing the photograph in the\nplace from where he had taken it, he jumped up and\nwent and sat at his writing-table, turning his back\nto the door.

Her eyes\nwere drawn up at the root of the nose and slanted\ntowards the temples; this gave them a pleading,\npatheclie expression, which stood in bewitching\ncontrast to the lower, roguish parts of her face ; she\nhad restless pupils, small like the point of a needle\nat one moment, and distended at the next, like the\nobjective of a night-tclescope.\n", "On entering the room, she removed the key from\nthe lock and shot the bolt.\n\nFalander remained sitting at his table, writing.\n\n\u201cYou are late to-day, Agnes,\u201d he said.\n\n* Yes, I know,\u201d she replied, defiantly, taking off\nher hat.\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201c We were up late last night.\u201d\n\n\u2018*\u201c Why don\u2019t you get up and say how do you do to\nme?

He felt old, tired,\nindifferent ; he had seen the houses at his feet from\nthe inside, and on every occasion his expectations\nhad been disappointed. He had scen humanity under\nmany aspects, aspects which are only revealed to\nthe eye of the poor man\u2019s doctor or the journalist,\nwith the only difference that the journalist generally\nsees men as they wish to appear, and the doctor as\nthey are. He had every opportunity of studying\nman as a social animal in all possible guises ; he\nhad been present at Parliamentary meetings, church\ncouncils, general meetings of shareholders, philan-\nthropie meetings, police court proceedings, festivals,\nfunerals, public meetings of working men; every-\nwhere he had heard big words and many words,\nwords never used in daily intercourse, a particular\nspecies of words which mean nothing, at least not\nwhat they ought to mean. This had given him a\none-sided conception of humanity; he could see in\nman nothing but the deceitful social animal, a\ncreature he is bound to be because civilization forbids\nepen war. His aloofness blinded him to the existence\nof another animal, an animal which \u201c between glass\nand wall\u201d is exceedingly amiable, as long as it is\n182\n", "not exasperated, and which is ready to come out\nwith all its failings and weaknesses when there are\nno witnesses. He was blind to it and that was the\nreason why he had become embittered.\n\nBut the worst of it all was he had lost his self-\nrespect. And that had happened without his having\ncommitted a single action of which he need have been\nashamed. He had been robbed of it by his fellow-\ncreatures, and it had not been a very difficult thing\nto do. He had been slighted everywhere, and how\ncould he, whose self-confidence had been destroyed\nin his early youth, respect a person whom every-\nbody despised ? With many a bitter pang he saw\nthat all Conservative journalists, that was to say\nmen who defended and upheld everything that was\nwrong\u2014or if they could not defend it, at least left\nit untouched\u2014were treated with the utmost courtesy.\nHe was despised, not so much as a pressman as in\nhis character of advocate of all those who were down-\ntrodden and hardly dealt with.\n\nHe had lived through times of cruel doubt. For\ninstance: in reporting the Gencral Mecting of\nShareholders of the Marine Insurance Society\n\u201cTriton,\u201d he had used the word swindle. In replying\nto his report, the Grey Bonnet had published a long\narticle proving so clearly that the society was a\nnational, patriotic, philanthropic institution that\nhe had almost felt convinced of having been wrong,\nand the thought of having recklessly played with the\nreputation of his fellow citizens was a nightmare\nto him for many days to come.\n\nHe was now in a state of mind which alternated\nbetween fanaticism and callousness ; his next impulse\nwould decide the direction his development was\nto take.\n\nHis life had been so dreary during the summer that\nhe welcomed with malicious pleasure every rainy day,\nand it was a comparatively pleasant sensation to\nwatch leaves rustling along the garden paths.\n\nHe sat absorbed in grimly humorous meditations\n", "on life and its purposes, when one lean, bony hand\nwas laid on his shoulder, and another clutched his\narm; he felt as if death had come to take him at his\nword. He looked up and started: before him stood\nYgberg, pale as a corpse, emaciated and looking at\nhim with those peculiarly washed out eyes which\nonly starvation produces.\n\n\u201c\u201cGood morning, Falk,\u201d he whispered, almost\ninaudibly, and his whole body seemed to rattle.\n\n\u201c\u201cGood morning, Ygberg,\u201d replied Falk, suddenly\nbrightening up. \u201cSit down and have a cup of\ncoffee! How are you? You look as if you had\nbeen lying under the ice.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! I\u2019ve been so ill, so ill!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou seem to have had as jolly a summer as I\nhad!\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* Have you had a hard time, too?\u201d asked Ygberg,\na faint hope that it had been the case brightening his\nyellow face.\n\n\u201cT can only say: Thank God that the cursed\nsummer is over! It might be winter all the year\nround for all I eare! Not only that once is suffering\nall the time, but one also has to wateh others enjoying\nthemselves! I never put a foot out of town; did\nyou?\u201d\nee I haven\u2019t seen a pine tree since Lundell left Lill-\nJans in June! And why should one want to sce\npine trees ? It isn\u2019t absolutely essential; nor is a\npine tree anything extraordinary ! But that one can\u2019t\nhave the pleasure, that\u2019s where the sting comes in.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well! Never mind! It\u2019s clouding over\nin the east, therefore it will rain to-morrow; and\nwhen the sun shines again, it will be autumn. Your\nhealth !\u201d\n\nYgberg looked at the punch as if it were poison,\nbut he drank it nevertheless.\n\n** But you wrote that beautiful story of the guardian\nangel, or the Marine Insurance Society * Triton,\u2019\nfor Smith,\u201d remarked Falk. \u2018\u201c\u2018 Didn\u2019t it go against\nyour convictions ?\u201d\n", "\u201cConvictions ? I have no convictions.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cHaven\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, only fools have convictions.\u201d\n\n** Have you no morals, Ygberg ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Whenever a fool has an idea\u2014it comes\nto the same thing whether it is original or not\u2014he\ncalls it his conviction, clings to it and boasts of it,\nnot because it is a conviction, but because it is his\nconviction. So far as the Marine Insurance Society\nis concerned, I believe it\u2019s a swindle! I\u2019m sure it\ninjures many men, the shareholders at all events, but\nit\u2019s a splendid thing for others, the directors and\neewloyt, for instance; so it does a fair amount\nof good, after all.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you lost all sense of honour, old friend ?\u201d\u201d\n\n*\u201cOne must sacrifice everything on the altar of\nduty.\u201d\n\n\u201cT admit that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe first and foremost duty of man is to live\u2014\nto live at any price! Divine as well as human law\ndemands it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne must never sacrifice honour.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth laws, as I said, demand the sacrifice of\neverything\u2014they compel a poor man to sacrifice\nhis so-called honour. It\u2019s cruel, but you can\u2019t blame\nthe poor man for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour theory of life is anything but cheerful.\u201d\n\n** How could it be otherwise ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true !\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c* But to talk of something else: I\u2019ve had a letter\nfrom Rehnhjelm. IJ\u2019ll read it to you, if you like.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u2018 T heard he had gone on the stage.\u201d\n\n\u2018. Yes, and he doesn\u2019t seem to be having a good time\nof it.\n\nYgberg took a letter from his breast-pocket, put\na piece of sugar into his mouth and began to read.\n\n\u201c* Tf there is a hell in a life after this, which is very\ndoubtful. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c'The lad\u2019s become a free-thinker ! \u201d\n\n\u201cIt cannot be a worse place than this. I\u2019ve been\n", "engaged for two months, but it seems to me like two\nyears. A devil, formerly a wheelwright, now\ntheatrical manager, holds my fate in his hand, and\ntreats me in such a way that three times a day I feel\ntempted to run away. But he has so carefully\ndrafted the penal clauses in the agreement, that my\nflight would dishonour my parents\u2019 name.\n\n\u201cJT have walked on every single night, but I\u2019ve\nnever been allowed to open my lips yet. For twenty\nconsecutive evenings I have had to smear my face\nwith umber and wear a gipsy\u2019s costume, not a single\npiece of which fits me; the tights are too long, the\nshoes too large, the jacket is too short. An under-\ndevil, called the prompter, takes good care that I\ndon\u2019t exchange my costume for one more suitable ;\nand whenever I try to hide myself behind the crowd,\nwhich is made up of the director-manufacturer\u2019s\nfactory hands, it opens and pushes me forward to the\nfootlights. If I look into the wings, my eyes fall on\nthe under-devil, standing there, grinning, and if I\nlook at the house, I see Satan himself sitting in a\nbox, laughing.\n\n\u201cT seem to have been engaged for his amusement,\nnot for the purpose of playing any parts. On one\noccasion I ventured to draw his attention to the fact\nthat I ought to have practice in speaking parts if\nI was ever going to be an actor. He lost his temper\nand said that one must learn to crawl before one can\nlearn to walk. Ireplicd that I could walk. He said\nit was a lic and asked me whether I imagined that\nthe art of acting, the most beautiful and difficult\nof all arts, required no training. When I said\nthat that was exactly what I did imagine, and\nthat I was impatiently waiting for the beginning of\nmy training, he told me I was an ignorant puppy,\nand he would kick me out. When I remonstrated,\nhe asked me whether I looked upon the stage as a\ntefuge for impecunious youths. My reply was a\nfrank, unconditional glad Yes. He roared that he\nwould kill me.\n", "\u201cThis is the present state of my affairs.\n\n\u2018<I feel that my soul is flickering out like a tallow\neandle in a draught, and I shall soon believe that\n\u2018 Evil will be victorious, even though it be concealed\nin clouds,\u2019 as the Catechism has it.\n\n*\u00ab But the worst of all is that I have lost all respect\nfor this art, which was the dream and the love of my\nboyhood. Can I help it when I see that men and\nwomen without education or culture, g teres on\nby vanity and -recklessness, completely lacking in\nenthusiasm and intelligence are able to play in a few\nmonths\u2019 time character parts, historical iia fairly\nwell, without having a glimmer of knowledge of the\ntime in which they move, or the important part which\nthe person they represent played in history ?\n\n\u00abTt is slow murder, and the association with this\nmob which keeps me down\u2014some of the members\nof the company have come into collision with various\nparagraphs of the penal code\u2014is making of me\nwhat I\u2019ve never been, an aristocrat. The pressure\nof the cultured can never weigh as heavily on the\nuncultured.\n\n\u201cThere is but one ray of light in this darkness: I\nam in love. She is purest gold among all this dross.\nOf course she, too, is persecuted and slowly murdered,\njust as I am, since she refused the stage-manager\u2019s\ninfamous proposals. She is the only woman with a\nliving spirit among all these beasts, wallowing in\nfilth, and she loves me with all her soul. We are\nsecretly engaged. I am only waiting for the day\nwhen I shall have won success, to make her my wife.\nBut when will that be ? We have often thought of\ndying together, but hope, treacherous hope, has\nalways beguiled us into continuing this misery. To\nsee my innocent love burning with shame when she is\nforced to wear improper costumes, is more than I\ncan bear. But I will an this unpleasant subject.\n\n\u201cOlle and Lundell sik to be remembered. Olle\nis very much changed. He has drifted into a new\nkind of philosophy, which tears down everything\n", "and turns all things upside down. It sounds very jolly\nand sometimes seems true, but it must be a dangerous\ndoctrine if carried out.\n\n\u2018\u2018T believe he owes these ideas to one of the actors\nhere, an intelligent and well-informed man, who lives\na very immoral life; I like and hate him at the same\ntime. He is a queer chap, fundamentally good,\nnoble and generous ; a man who will sacrifice himself\nfor his friends. I eannot fix on any special vice,\nbut he is immoral, and a man without morality is a\nblackguard\u2014don\u2019t you think so ?\n\n**I must stop, my angel, my good spirit is coming.\nThere is a happy hour in store for me ; all evil spirits\nwill flee, and I shall be a better man.\n\n\u2018Remember me to Falk and tell him to think of\nme when life is hard on him.\n\n\u201cYour friend R.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cWell, what do you think of that ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the old story of the struggle of the wild\nbeasts. Il tell you what, Ygberg, I believe one\nhas to be very unscrupulous if one wants to get on\nin the world.\u201d\n\n\u201c'Try it! You may not find it so easy!\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you still doing business with Smith ? \u201d\n\n\u2018*No, unfortunately not! And you?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cT\u2019ve seen him on the subject of my poems. He\nhas bought them, ten crowns the folio, and he ean\nnow murder me in the same way as the wheelwright\nis murdering Rehnhjelm. And I\u2019m afraid some-\nthing of the sort is going to happen, for I haven\u2019t\nheard a word about them. Ile was so exceedingly\nfriendly that I expect the worst. If only I knew\nwhat\u2019s going on! But what\u2019s the matter with you ?\nYou\u2019re as white as a sheet.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cThe truth is,\u201d replied Ygberg, clutching the\nrailings, \u2018\u2018all I\u2019ve had to eat these last two days has\nbeen five lumps of sugar. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to faint.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cTf food will set you right, I can help you ; fortu-\nnately I have some money. \u201d\n", "** Of course it will set me right,\u201d whispered Ygberg\nfaintly.\n\nBut it was not so. When they were sitting in the\ndining-room and food was served to them, Ygberg\ngrew worse, and Falk had to take him to his room,\nwhich fortunately was not very far off.\n\nThe house was an old, one-story house built of\nwood ; it had climbed on to a rock and looked as if\nit suffered from hip-disease. It was spotted like\na leper; a long time ago it was going to be painted,\nbut when the old paint had been burned off, nothing\nmore was done to it; it looked in every respect\nmiserable, and it was hard to believe the legend of\nthe sign of the Fire Insurance Office, rusting on the\nwall, namely, that a phoenix should rise from the\nashes.\n\nAt the base of the house grew dandelions, nettles,\nand roadweed, the faithful companions of poverty ;\nsparrows were bathing in the scorching sand and\nscattering it about; pale-faced children with big\nstomachs, looking as if they were being brought up\non 90 per cent. of water, were making dandelion\nchains and trying to embitter their sad lives by\nannoying and insulting each other.\n\nFalk and Ygberg climbed a rotten, creaking staircase\nand came to a \u201c\u2014 room. It was divided into\nthree parts by chalk lines. The first and second\ndivisions served a joiner and a cobbler as workshops ;\nthe third was exclusively devoted to the more intimate\npursuits of family life.\n\nWhenever the children screamed, which happened\nonce in every quarter of an hour, the joiner flew into\na rage and burst out scolding and swearing; the\ncobbler remonstrated with quotations from the\nBible. The joiner\u2019s nerves were so shattered by these\nconstant screams, the unceasing punishments and\nscoldings, that five minutes after partaking of the\nsnuff of reconciliation offered by the cobbler, he flew\ninto a fresh temper in spite of his firm resolve to be\n", "patient. Consequently he was nearly all day long\nin a red-hot fury. But the worst passages were\nwhen he asked the woman, \u201cwhy these infernal\nfemales need bring so many children into the world ; \u201d\nthen the woman question came on the tapis and his\nantagonist gave him as good as he brought.\n\nFalk and Ygberg had to pass this room to gain\nthe latter\u2019s garret, and although both of them went\non tiptoe, they wakened two of the children ;_ imme-\ndiately the mother began humming a lullaby, thereby\ninterrupting a discussion between cobbler and joiner ;\nnaturally the latter nearly had a fit.\n\n\u201cHold your tongue, woman !\u201d\n\n** Hold your tongue yourself! Can\u2019t you let the\nchildren sleep ? \u201d\n\n** To hell with the children !_ Are they my children ?\nAm I to suffer for other people\u2019s immorality ?. Am\nIanimmoral man? What? Have I any children ?\nHold your tongue, I say, or V\u2019ll throw my plane at\nyour head.\u201d\n\n\u201cIT say, master, master!\u2019 began the cobbler ;\n\u201cyou shouldn\u2019t talk like that of the children; God\nsends the little ones into the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lie, eobbler! The devil sends them!\nThe devil! And then the dissolute parents blame\nGod! You ought to be ashamed of yourselves ! \u201d\n\n\u201c*Master, master! You shouldn\u2019t use such lJan-\nguage! Scripture tells us that the kingdom of heaven\nbelongs to the children.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, indeed! They have them in the kingdom\nof heaven, have they ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare you talk like that!\u201d shrilled the\nfurious mother. \u2018\u201c\u2018If you ever have any children\nof your own, I shall pray that they may be lame\nand discased ; I shall pray that they shall be blind\nand deaf and dumb; I shall pray that they shall be\nsent to the reformatory and end on the gallows; see\nif IT won\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo so for all I care, you good-for-nothing hussy !\nI\u2019m not going to bring children into the world to\n", "see them living a dog\u2019s life. You ought to be sent\nto the House of Correction, for bringing the poor\nthings into all this misery. You are married, you\nsay ? Well! Need you be immoral because you are\nmarried ? \u201d\n\n\u201cMaster, master! God sends the children.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lie, cobbler! I read in a paper the other\nday that the damned potato is to blame for the\nlarge families of the poor ; don\u2019t you see, the potato\nconsists of two substances, called oxygen and nitrogen ;\nwhenever these substances occur in a certain quantity\nand proportion, women become prolific.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what is one to do?\u201d asked the angry\nmother, whom this interesting explanation had\ncalmed down a little.\n\n\u201cOne shouldn\u2019t eat potatoes; can\u2019t you see\nthat ?\u201d\n\n** But what is one to eat if not potatoes ?\u201d\n\n\u201c Beef-steak, woman! Steak and onions! What!\nIsn\u2019t that good? Or steak 4 la Chateaubriand !\nDo you know what that is? What? I saw in\nthe \u2018Fatherland\u2019 the other day that a woman who\nhad taken womb-grain very nearly died as well as\nthe baby.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that ?\u201d asked the mother, pricking up\nher ears.\n\n\u201cYou'd like to know, would you ?\u201d\n\n\u201c* Ts it true what you just said about womb-grain ? \u201d\nasked the cobbler, blinking his eyes.\n\n\u201c\u201cHoho! That brings up your lungs and liver,\nbut there\u2019s a heavy penalty on it, and that\u2019s as it\nshould be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it as it should be ?\u201d\u2019 asked the cobbler dully.\n\n\u201c* Of course it is! Immorality must be punished ;\nand it\u2019s immoral to murder one\u2019s children.\u201d\n\n\u201cChildren! Surely, there\u2019s a difference,\u201d replied\nthe angry mother, resignedly ; \u2018\u2018 but where does the\nstuff you just spoke about come from, master ? \u201d\n\n\u201cHaha! You want more children, you hussy,\nalthough you are a widow with five! Beware of that\n", "devil of a cobbler! He\u2019s hard on women, in spite of\nhis piety. A pinch of snuff, cobbler ? \u201d\n\n\u201cThere is really a herb then. . . .\u201d\n\n*\u201cWho said it was a herb? Did I say so? No;\nit\u2019s an organic substance. Let me tell you, all\nsubstanees\u2014nature contains about sixty\u2014are divided\ninto organic and inorganic substances. This one\u2019s\nLatin name is cornuticus secalias; it comes from\nabroad, for instance from the Calabrian Peninsula.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cIs it very expensive, master?\u201d asked the\ncobbler.\n\n\u201cExpensive !\u201d ejaculated the joiner, manipulating\nhis plane as if it were a carbine. \u201cIt\u2019s awfully\nexpensive !\u201d\n\nFalk had listened to the conversation with great\ninterest. Now he started; he had heard a carriage\nstopping underneath the window, and the sound of\ntwo women\u2019s voices which seemed familiar to him.\n\n**'This house looks all right.\u201d\n\n** Does it ?\u201d\u2019 said an older voice. \u2018\u2018 I think it looks\ndreadful.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT meant it looks all right for our purpose.

It was a despondent-looking\nshadow, and the nearer he came the more despondent\nit looked. .\n\nOn entering his room he saw Struve sitting at his\nwriting-table with his head on his hands. His\nclothes were soaked with rain and clung heavily to his\nbody ; there were little puddles on the floor which\nslowly drained off through the chinks. His hair hung\nin damp strands from his head, and his usually English\nwhiskers fell like stalactites on his damp coat collar.\nHe had placed his black hat beside him on the table ;\nit had collapsed under its own weight, and the wide\ncrape band which it was wearing suggested that it\nwas mourning for its lost youth.\n\n\u201cGood evening,\u201d said Falk. \u201cThis is an un-\nexpected honour.\u201d\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t jeer at me,\u201d begged Struve.\n\n\u201c\u201cAnd why not?

But isn\u2019t life bitter enough\nwithout our unnecessarily embittering it still further ?\nIf God, or Providence, is amused at it, need it follow\nthat man should equally degrade himself ? \u201d\n\n\u201cThat sounds reasonable and does you honour.\nWon\u2019t you put on my dressing-gown while you are\ndrying your clothes ? You must be cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you! But I mustn\u2019t stay.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Stayalittle while!

If you want to escape self-immolation, a\nfate which in your fanaticism you are fast approach-\ning, change your point of view as soon as possible.\nTake a bird\u2019s-eye view of the world, and you will see\nhow small and insignificant everything is. Start with\nthe conviction that the whole world is a rubbish heap ;\nthat men are the refuse, no better than egg-shells,\ncarrot stalks, cabbage leaves, rags ; then nothing will\ntake you by surprise, you will never lose an illusion ;\nbut, on the contrary, you will be filled with a great\njoy whenever you come across a fine thought, a good\naction ; try to acquire a calm contempt of the world\n\u2014you needn\u2019t be afraid of growing callous,\u201d\n\n\u2018**T have not yet attained to that point of view, it\u2019s\ntrue, but I have a contempt for the world.

You're not the\nsame man; you used to be so gentle.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201c We discussed that before! Speak up!\u201d\n\n\u201c*T want to ask you whether you would come with\nme to the churchyard.\u201d\n\n\u201cI? Why don\u2019t you ask one of your colleagues\nfrom the Grey Bonnet ? \u201d\n\n\u201cThere are reasons. I don\u2019t see why I shouldn\u2019t\ntell you. I\u2019m not married.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cNot married! You! The defender of religion\nand morality, have broken the sacred bonds ! \u201d\n\n\u201cPoverty, the force of cireumstanees! But I\u2019m\njust as happy as if I were marricd! I love my\nwife and she loves me, and that\u2019s all. But there\u2019s\nanother reason. The child has not been baptized ;\nit was three weeks old when it dicd, and therefore no\nclergyman will bury it. I don\u2019t dare to tell this to\nmy wife, because she would fret. Ive told her the\nclergyman would meet us in the churchyard; [\u2019m\ntelling you this to prevent a possible scene. She, of\ncourse, will remain at home. You'll only meet two\nother fellows ; one of them, Levi, is a younger brother\nof the director of the \u2018 Triton,\u2019 and one of the employ\u00e9s\nof that socicty. He\u2019s a decent sort, with an unusually\ngood head and a still better heart, Don\u2019t laugh, I can\n", "see that you think I\u2019ve borrowed money from him\u2014\nand so I have\u2014he\u2019s a man you\u2019ll like. \u2018The other one\nis my old friend, Dr. Borg, who treated the little one.\nHe is very broad-minded, a man without any pre-\njudices ; you'll get on with him! Ican count on you,\ncan\u2019t 1? There\u2019ll be four of us in the coach, and the\nlittle coffin, of course.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, I'll come.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing. My wife has religious\nscruples and is afraid that the little one won\u2019t go to\nheaven because he died without baptism. She asks\neverybody\u2019s opinion on the subject, so as to ease her\nmind.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what about the Augsburg Confession ? \u201d\u2019\n\n** Tt\u2019s not a question of confessions.\u201d\u2019\n\n** But in writing to your paper, you always uphold\nthe official faith.\u201d\n\n\u201c* The paper is the affair of the syndicate ; if it likes\nto cling to Christianity, it may do so for all I care!\nMy work for the syndicate is a matter apart. Please\nagree with my wife if she tells you that she believes\nthat her child will go to heaven.\u201d\n\n\u201cIT don\u2019t mind denying the faith in order to make a\nhuman heart happy, particularly as I don\u2019t hold it.\nBut you haven\u2019t told me yet where you live.\u201d\n\n* Do you know where the White Mountains are ? \u201d\n\n\u201cYes! Are you living in the spotted house on the\nmountain rock ? \u201d\u2019\n\n** Do you know it ?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cTve been there once.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen perhaps you know Ygberg, the Socialist,\nwho leads the people astray ?

After a brief good-night they parted.\n\nFalk found the atmosphere in his room stifling ; he\nopened the window. The rain was coming down in\ntorrents, splashing on the tiles and running down into\nthe dirty street. Tattoo sounded in the barracks\nopposite ; vespers were being sung in the lodgment ;\nfragments of the verses floated through the open\nwindow.\n\nFalk felt lonely and tired. He had been longing to\nfight a battle with a representative of all he regarded\nas inimical to progress ; but the enemy, aiter having\nto some extent beaten him, had fled. He tried to\nunderstand clearly what the quarrel was about, but\nfailed in his effort; he was unable to say who was\nright. He asked himself whether the cause he served,\nnamely, the cause of the oppressed, had any existence.\nBut at the next moment he reproached himself with\ncowardice, and the steady fanaticism which glowed\nin him burst into fresh flames; he condemned the\nweakness which again and again had induced him to\nyield. Just now he had held the enemy in his hand,\nand not only had he not shown him his profound re-\npugnance, but he had even treated him with kindness\nand sympathy ; what would he think of him ?\n\nThere was no merit in this good nature, as it pre-\n", "vented him from coming to a firm decision ; it was\nnothing but moral laxity, making him incapable of\ntaking up a fight which seemed more and more beyond\nhim. He realized that he must extinguish the fire\nunder the boilers ; they would not be able to stand\nthe pressure, as no steam was being used. He\npondered over Struve\u2019s advice, and brooded until his\nmind was chaos in which truth and lies, right and\nwrong, danced together in complete harmony ; his\nbrain in which, owing to his academic training, all\nconceptions had been so neatly pigeon-holed, would\nsoon resemble a pack of well-shuftled cards.\n\nHe succeeded bovond expectation in working him-\nself into a state of complete indifference ; he looked\nfor fine motives in the actions of his enemies, and\ngradually it appeared to him that he had all along\nbeen in the wrong ; he felt reconciled to the existing\norder of things, and ultimately came to the fine con-\nclusion that it was quite immaterial whether the\nwhole was black or white. Whatever was, had to be ;\nhe was not entitled to criticize it. He found this mood\npleasant, it gave him a feeling of restfulness to which\nhe had been a stranger all those years during which\nhe had made the troubles of humanity his own.\n\nHe was enjoying this calm and a pipe of strong\ntobacco, when a maid servant brought him a letter\njust delivered by the postman. It was from Olle\nMontanus and very long. Parts of it seemed to\nimpress Falk greatly.\n\nMy DEAR FELLOW, [it ran,]\n\nAlthough Lundell and I have now finished our\nwork and will soon be back in Stockholm, I yet feel\nthe need of writing down my impressions, because\nthey have been of great importance to myself and my\nspiritual development. I have come to a conclusion,\nand I am as full of amazement as a chicken which has\njust been hatched, and stares at the world with its\nnewly opened eyes, trampling on the egg-shell which\nhad shut out the light for so long. The conclusion, of\n", "course, is not a new one ; Plato propounded it before\nChristianity was; the world, the visible world, is but\na delusion, the reflexion of the ideas ; that is to say,\nreality is something low, insignificant, secondary and\naccidental. Yes! but I will proceed synthetically,\nbegin with the particular and pass on from it to the\ngeneral.\n\nI will speak of my work first, in which both Govern-\nment and Parliament have been interested. On the\naltar of the church at Traskola two wooden figures\nused to stand ; one of them was broken, but the other\none was whole. The whole one, the figure of a\nwoman, held a cross in her hand ; two sacks of frag-\nments of the broken one were preserved in the\nsacristy. A learned archxologist had examined the\ncontents of the two sacks, in order to determine the\nappearance of the broken figure, but the result had\nbeen mere conjecture.\n\nBut he had been very thorough. He had taken a\nspecimen of the white paint with which the figure had\nbeen grounded, and sent it to the Pharmaceutical\nInstitute ; the latter had reported that it contained\nlead and not zine; therefore, the figure must date\nfrom before 1844, because zine-white did not come\ninto use until after that date. (What can one say to\nsuch a conclusion, seeing that the figure might have\nbeen painted over!) Next he sent a sample of the\nwood to the Stockholm timber office; he was in-\nformed that it was birch. The figure was therefore\nmade of birchwood and dated from before 1844.\n\nBut that was not all he was striving for. He had\na reason (!) in plain words, he wished for his own\naggrandisement, that the carved figures should be\nproved to date from the sixteenth century ; and he\nwould have preferred that they should be the work\nof the great\u2014of course great, because his name had\nbeen so deeply carved in oak that it has been pre-\nserved to our time\u2014Burchard von Schiedenhanne,\nwho had carved the seats in the choir of the Cathedral\nof Visteros.\n", "The learned research was carried on. The pro-\nfessor stole a little plaster from the figures in Vasteros\nand sent it, together with a specimen from the sacristy\nof Triiskola to the Ekole Pollytechnik (I can\u2019t spell\nit). \u2018The reply completely crushed the scoffers ; the\nanalysis proved that the two specimens of args\nwere identical; both contained 77 per cent. of chalk\nand 85 of sulphuric acid ; therefore (!) the figures must\ndate from the same period.\n\nThe age of the figures had now been settled; a\nsketch was made of the whole one and \u201csent in\u201d\n(what a terrible passion these learned men have for\n\u201csending things in\u201d\u2019) to the Academy; the only\nthing which remained to be done was to determine\nand reconstruct the broken one. For two whole\nyears the two sacks travelled up and down between\nUpsala and Lund; the two professors differed and\ncarried on a lively dispute. The professor of Lund,\nwho had just been tide rector, took the figure as the\nsubject of his inaugural address and crushed the pro-\nfessor of Upsala. The latter replied in a brochure.\nFortunately at the very moment a professor of the\nStockholm Academy of Art appeared with a totally\nnew opinion ; then:Herod and Pilate \u2018\u2018 compromised,\u201d\nas is always the case, and attacked the man from\nthe capital, rending him with the unbridled fury of\nprovincials.\n\nThis was their Ps aati : the broken figure had\nrepresented Unbelief, because the other one must have\nbeen meant for Faith, whose symbol is the cross.\nThe supposition (advanced by the professor of Lund)\nthat the broken figure had been intended to represent\nHope, arrived at because one of the sacks contained\nan anchor, was rejected, because that would have\npostulated a third figure, Love, of which there was no\ntrace, and for which there could have been no room ;\nmoreover, it was proved by specimens from the rich\ncollection of arrow-heads in the historical museum,\nthat the fragment in question was not an anchor, but\nan arrowhead, which forms a part of the weapons\n\nis)\n", "belonging to the symbols of Unbelicf. The shape of the\narrowhead, which resembled in every detail those\nfrom the period of the Vice-regent Sture, removed\nthe last doubt as to the age of the figure.\n\nIt was my task to make a statue of Unbelicf, as a\ncompanion to the figure of Faith, in accordance with\nthe directions of the professors. I was given my in-\nstructions and I did not hesitate. I looked for a male\nmodel, for the figure was to be a man; I had to look\nfor a long time, but I found him in the end; I really\nbelieve I met the personification of Unbelief\u2014and I\nsuceceded brilliantly.\n\nAnd there he now stands, Falander, the actor, to\nthe left of the altar, with a Mexican bow (used in\nthe drama Ferdinand Cortez) and a robber\u2019s cloak\n(from Fra Diavolo), but the people say that it is\nUnbelief throwing down his arms before Faith. And\nthe Deputy-Superintendent, who preached the in-\naugural sermon, spoke of the splendid gifts which God\nsometimes gives to man, and which, in this case, he\nhad given to me; and the Count, who gave the in-\naugural dinner, declared that I had created a master-\npiece, fit to stand side by side with the antiques\n(he\u2019s been in Italy); and a student who occupies some\npost in the Count\u2019s household, seized the opportunity\nto write and circulate some verses, in which he\ndeveloped the conception of the Sublimely Beautiful,\nand gave a history of the Myth of the Devil.\n\nUp to now I have, like a true egoist, spoken only of\nmyself. What am I to say about Lundell\u2019s altar-\npiece ? I will try to describe it to you. Christ\n(Rehnhjelm) hangs on the cross in the background ;\nto the left is the impenitent thief (I; and the rascal\nhas made me worse-looking than Iam); to the right\nthe repenting thief (Lundell himself, squinting with\nhypocritical eyes at Rehnhjelm); at the foot of the\ncross Mary Magdalene (you will remember Marie\u2014in\na very low dress), and a Roman centurion (Falander) on\nhorseback (stallion belonging to Alderman Olsson).\n\nI cannot describe the awful impression made on_me\n", "when, after the sermon, the picture was unveiled, and\nI saw all these well-known faces staring from the wall\nabove the altar at the community oS , listen-\ning to the words of the preacher on the great import-\nance of art, particularly art in the service of religion.\nAs far as I am concerned, a veil has been lifted from\nmany things; I will tell you by and by my thoughts\non Faith and Unbelief. I am going to embody my\nviews on art and its high mission in an essay, and read\nit at some public hall as soon as I am back in town.\n\nIt goes without saying that Lundell\u2019s religious sense\nhas tremendously developed during those \u2018dear \u201d\ndays. He is, comparatively speaking, happy in his\ncolossal self-deception, and has no idea what a rascal\nhe really is.\n\nI think I have told you everything now ; anything\nelse verbally when we meet. Until then, good-bye.\nI hope you are in good health and spirits.\n\nYour friend,\nOtte Montanus.\n\nP.S. I must not forget to tell you the result of the\nantiquarian research. The end of it all was that old\nJan, an inmate of the almshouses, remembered having\nseen the figures when he was a child. He said there\nhad been three: Faith, Hope, and Love; and as\nLove was the greatest of these, it had stood above the\naltar. In the first decade of this century a flash of\nlightning had struck Love and Faith. The figures\nhad been the work of his father who was a carver of\nfigure-heads in the naval port Karlskrona.\n\nO. M.\n\nWhen Falk had read the letters, he sat down at his\nwriting-table, examined his lamp to see whether there\nwas plenty of oil in it, lit his pipe, took a manuscript\nfrom his table-drawer, and began to write,\n", "CHAPTER XIX\n\nFROM CHURCHYARD TO PUBLIC-HOUSE\nTue September afternoon lay grey and warm and\nstill over the capital as Falk climbed the hills in the\nsouth. When he had arrived at the churchyard of\nSt. Catherine\u2019s he sat down to rest ; he noticed with\na feeling of genuine pleasure that the maples had\nturned colour during the recent cold nights, and he\nwelcomed autumn with its darkness, its grey clouds,\nand falling leaves.\n\nNot a breath stirred; it was as if Nature were\nresting, tired after the work of the short summer.\nEverything was asleep ; the dead were lying beneath\nthe sod, calm and peaceful, as if they had never been\nalive ; he wished that he had all men there, and that\nhe, himself, was with them.\n\nThe clock on the tower chimed the hour, and he\nrose and continued his walk. He went down Garden\nStrect, turned into New Street\u2014which looked as if it\nhad been new a hundred years ago at least\u2014crossed\nthe New Market, and came to the White Mountains.\n\nHe stood still before the spotted house, listening\nto the children\u2019s chatter, for, as usual, there were\nchildren playing about the street ; they talked loudly\nand unreservedly while they were busy polishing\nlittle pieces of brick, presently to be used in a game\nof hop-scotch.\n\n\u2018** What did you have for dinner, Janne ? \u201d\n\n\u2018**'That\u2019s my business ! \u201d\n\n\u201cYour business? Did you say it was your\nbusiness ? Mind what you\u2019re about or you'll get a\nhiding.\u201d -\n", "* Don\u2019t brag! You with your eyes!\u201d\n\n** Who shoved you into the lake the other day ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! shut up!\u201d\n\nJanne received a thrashing, and peace was restored.\n\n\u201c\u201cI say! You stole eress in the churchyard the\nother day, didn\u2019t you, Janne ?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cThat cripple Olee split on me!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you were nabbed by the police, weren\u2019t\nyou ?\u201d\nms Who cares for the police? I don\u2019t!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you? Come along of us to-night then ;\nwe're going to pinch some pears.\u201d\n\n\u2018** There\u2019s a savage dog behind the fence !\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c*Garn! Chimney-sweep\u2019s Peter\u2019ll climb over and\na kick\u2019ll do for the dog.\u201d\n\nThe polishing was interrupted by a maid-servant\nwho came out of the house and began to scatter pine\nbranches on the grass-grown street.\n\n** Who\u2019s going to be buried ? \u201d\n\n**'The deputy\u2019s wife\u2019s baby ! \u201d\n\n** He\u2019s a proper old Satan, the deputy, isn\u2019t he ?\u201d\n\nInstead of replying, the other began whistling an\nunknown and very peculiar tune.\n\n** Let\u2019s thrash his red-haired cubs when they come\nhome from school! I say! Doesn\u2019t his old woman\nfancy herself? The old she-devil locked us out in\nthe snow the other night because we couldn\u2019t pay\nthe rent, and we had to spend the night in the barn.\u201d\n\n\u2018The conversation flickered out; the last item of\nconversation had not made the smallest impression\non Janne\u2019s friend.\n\nAfter this introduction to the status of the tenants\nby the two urchins, Falk entered the house not with\nthe pleasantest of sensations. He was received at\nthe door by Struve, who looked distressed, and took\nFalk\u2019s arm as if he were going to confide a secret to\nhim, or suppress a tear\u2014he had to do something, so\nhe embraced him.\n\nFalk found himself in a big room with a dining-\ntable, a sideboard, six chairs, and a coffin. White\n", "sheets were hanging before the windows through\nwhich the daylight filtered and broke at the red glow\nof the tallow candles; on the table stood a tray\nwith green wine glasses, and a soup turcen filled\nwith dahlias, stocks, and white asters.\n\nStruve seized Falk\u2019s hand and led him to the\ncoffin where the baby lay bedded on shavings, covered\nwith tulle, and strewn with fuchsias.\n\n\u201cThere !\u201d\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018 there !\u201d\n\nFalk felt nothing but the quite commonplace\nemotion the living always feel in the presence of the\ndead ; he could think of nothing suitable to say, and\ntherefore he confined himself to pressing the father\u2019s\nhand. \u2018\u2018 Thank you, thank you,\u201d stammered Struve,\nand disappeared in an adjoining room.\n\nFalk was left alone; he could hear excited whis-\npering behind the door through which Struve had\nvanished; then it grew still for a while; but\npresently a murmur from the other end of the room\npenetrated the matchboard wall. A strident treble\nseemed to be reciting long verses with ineredible\nvolubility.\n\n\u2018* Babebibobubybaib\u00e9\u2014Babebibobubybab6\u2014Babe-\nbibobubybab\u00e9,\u201d it sounded.\n\nAn angry man\u2019s voice answered to the accompani-\nment of a plane which said hwitcho\u2014hwitcho\u2014\nhwitch\u2014hwitech\u2014hitch\u2014hitch.\n\nAnda long-drawn, rumbling mum-mum-mum-mum-\nmum-mum-mum-mum replied, seemingly anxious to\ncalm the storm. But the plane spat and sneezed.\nagain its hwitch\u2014hwitch, and immediately after a\nstorm of Babili\u2014bebili\u2014bibili\u2014bobili\u2014bubili\u2014\nbybili\u2014babili\u2014b6\u2014broke out with fresh fury.\n\nFalk guessed the subject under discussion, and a\ncertain intonation gave him the idea that the dead\nbaby was involved in the argument.\n\nThe whispering, occasionally interrupted by loud\nsobs, began again behind the door through which\nStruve had diasppeared ; finally it was pushed open\nand Struve appeared leading by the hand a woman\n", "who looked like a laundress; she was dressed in\nblack, and her cyelids were red and swollen with\nweeping. Struve introduced her with all the dignity\nof a father of a family :\n\n\u201c* My wife, Mr. Falk, my old friend.\u201d\n\nFalk clasped a hand, hard as a beetle, and received\na vinegary smile. He cast about for a few platitudes\ncontaining the words \u201c\u2018 wife \u201d and \u201c grief,\u201d and as he\nwas fairly successful, he was rewarded by Struve with\nan embrace.\n\nMrs. Struve, anxious not to be left out in the cold,\nbegan brushing the back of her husband\u2019s coat.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dreadful how you seem to pick up every bit\nof dirt, Christian,\u201d she said; \u201c\u2018 your back\u2019s always\ndusty. Don\u2019t you think that my husband always\nlooks like a pig, Mr. Falk ?\u201d\n\nThere was no need for poor Falk to reply to this\ntender remark; behind the mother\u2019s back now\nappeared two heads, regarding the visitor with a grin.\nThe mother patted them affectionately.\n\n\u201c\u201cHave you ever seen plainer boys before, Mr.\nFalk ?\u201d\u2019 she asked. \u201c\u2018 Don\u2019t they look exactly like\nyoung foxes ?\u201d\n\nThis statement was so undeniably accurate that\nFalk felt compelled to deny it eagerly.\n\nThe opening of the hall door and the entrance of\ntwo men stopped all further civilities. The first of\nthe new-comers was a man of thirty, broad-shouldered,\nwith a square head, the front of which was supposed\nto represent the face ; the skin looked like the half- ,\nrotten plank of a bridge in which worms have\nploughed their labyrinths ; the wide mouth, always\nslightly open, showed the four shining eye-tecth ;\nwhenever he smiled his face seemed to split into two\nshe his mouth opened as far back as the fourth\n\nack tooth; not a single hair grew in the barren\nsoil; the nose was so badly put on that one could\nsee through it far into the head; on the upper part\nof the skull grew something which looked like cocoa-nut\nmatting. .\n", "Struve, who possessed the faculty of ennobling his\nenvironment, introduced Candidate Borg as Dr. Borg.\nThe latter, without a sign of either pleasure or annoy-\nance, held out his arm to his companion, who pulled\noff the coat and hung it on the hinge of the front door,\nan act which drew from Mrs. Struve the remark that\nthe old house was in such bad repair that there was\nnot even a hall-stand.\n\nThe man who had helped Borg off with his over-\ncoat was introduced as Mr. Levi. He was a tall,\novergrown youth; the skull seemed but a backward\ndevelopment of the nasal bone, and the trunk which\nreached to the knees, looked as if it had been drawn\nthrough a wire plate, in the way in which wire is\ndrawn ; the shoulders slanted like eaves ; there was\nno trace of hips, the shanks ran up into the thighs ;\nthe feet were worn out of shape like a pair of old\nshoes; the instep had given way. The fogs eurved\noutward and downward, like the legs of a working\nman who has carried heavy loads, or stood for the\ngreater part of his life. He was a pure slave-type.\n\nThe candidate had remained at the door; he had\ntaken off his gloves, put down his stick, blown his\nnose, and put back the handkerchief into his pocket\nwithout taking the least notice of Struve\u2019s repeated\nattempts to introduce him; he believed that he was\nstill in the entrance hall; but now he took his hat,\nseraped the floor with his foot and made a step into\nthe room.\n\n\u2018** Good morning, Jenny! How are you ?\u201d\u2019 he said,\nseizing Mrs. Struve\u2019s hand with as much eagerness\nas if it were a matter of life and death. He bowed,\nhardly pereeptibly, to Falk, with the snar] of a dog\nwho sces a strange dog in its yard.\n\nYoung Mr. Levi followed at the heels of the\ncandidate, responding to his smiles, applauding his\nsarcasms, and generally kow-towing to his superiority.\n\nMrs. Struve opened a bottle of hock and filled the\nglasses. Struve raised his glass and welcomed his\nguests. The candidate opened his mouth, made a\n", "canal of his tongue, poured the contents of the glass\non it, grinned as if it were physic and swallowed it.\n\n*Tt\u2019s awfully sour and nasty,\u201d said Mrs. Struve ;\n\u2018** would you prefer a glass of punch, Henrik ? \u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018\u201c Yes, it as very nasty,\u201d agreed the candidate,\nand Levi eagerly seconded him.\n\nThe punch was brought in. Borg\u2019s face brightened ;\nhe looked for a chair, and immediately Levi brought\nhim one.\n\nThe party sat down round the dining-table. The\nstrong scent of the stocks mingled with the smell of\nthe wine; the candles were reflected in the glasses,\nthe conversation became lively, and soon a column\nof smoke stood above the candidate\u2019s chair. Mrs.\nStruve glanced uneasily at the little sleeper near the\nwindow, but nobody saw her look.\n\nPresently a coach stopped in the street outside the\nhouse. Everybody rose except the candidate.\nStruve coughed, and in a low voice, as if he had\nsomething unpleasant to say, he whispered :\n\n\u201c* Shall we get ready now ?\u201d\n\nMrs. Struve went to the coffin and stooped over it,\nweeping bitterly; when, in drawing back, she saw\nher husband standing behind her with the coffin lid,\nshe burst into loud sobs.\n\n\u201cThere, there, compose yourself,\u201d said Struve,\nhastening to screw down the lid as if he wanted to\nhide something. Borg, looking like a yawning horse,\ngulped down another glass of punch. Mr. Levi\nhelped Struve to screw down the lid, displaying quite\nextraordinary skill; he seemed to be packing a bale\nof goods.\n\nThe men shook hands with Mrs. Struve, put on\ntheir overcoats and went; the woman warned them\nto be careful in going downstairs ; the stairs were old\nand rotten.\n\nStruve marched in front, carrying the coffin ; when\nhe stepped into the street and became aware of the\nlittle crowd which had collected before the house, he\nfelt flattered, and the devil of pride took possession\n", "of him. He seolded the driver who had omitted to\nopen the door and Iet down the steps; to heighten\nthe effect of his words, he spoke with contemptuous\nfamiliarity to the tall man in livery who, hat in hand,\nhastened to carry out his commands.\n\nFrom the centre of the erowd, where the boy Janne\nwas standing, came a short, scornful cough; but\nwhen the boy saw that he was attracting universal\nattention, he raised his eyes towards the chimneys,\nand seemed to be eagerly looking for the sweep.\n\nThe door of the coach slammed behind the four\nmen; a lively conversation broke out between some\nof the younger members of the mass-meecting, who\nnow felt more at their case.\n\n\u201cTsay, what a swell coffin! Did you see it ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes! But did you see that there was no name\non it ?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c'Wasn\u2019t there ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Didn\u2019t you see it ? It was quite plain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy was that, then ?\u201d\n\n** Don\u2019t youknow ? Because he was a bastard...\u201d\n\nThe whip cracked, and the coach rumbled off.\nFalk\u2019s eyes strayed to the window; he caught a\nglimpse of Mrs. Struve, who had already removed\nsome of the sheets, blowing out the candles ; and he\nsaw the two cubs standing by the side of her, cach\nwith a glass of wine in his hand.\n\nThe coach rattled along, through street after street ;\nnobody attempted to speak. Struve, sitting with the\ncoffin on his knees, looked embarrassed ; it was still\ndaylight ; he longed to make himself invisible.\n\nIt was a long journey to the churchyard, but\nit finally came to an end. They arrived.\n\nA row of coaches stood before the gate. They\nbought wreaths and the gravedigger took possession\nof the coffin. After a lengthy walk, the small pro-\ncession stopped quite at the back on the north side\nof the churchyard, close to a new sandfield.\n\nThe gravedigger placed the coffin in position.\n\nBorg commanded :\n", "\u201cHold tight! Ease off! Let go!\u201d\n\nAnd the little nameless child was lowered three\nyards into the ground.\n\nThere was a pause; all heads were bowed and all\neyes. looking into the grave, as if they were waiting\nfor something.\n\nA leaden sky gloomed dismally over the large,\ndeserted sandfield, the white poles of which looked\nlike the shadows of little children who had lost their\nway. The dark wood might have been the back-\nground in a magic lantern show; the wind was\nhushed.\n\nAll of a sudden a voice rose, tremulous at first,\nbut growing in clearness and intensity, as if it were\nspeaking from an inner conviction. Levi was stand-\ning on the pall, bare-headed :\n\n\u201cIn the safe keeping of the Most High, resting in\nthe shadow of His omnipotence, I say to the Eternal :\nOh, Thou my stronghold, my defence in all eternity,\nmy God in whom I trust\u2014Kaddisch. Lord,\nAlmighty God, let Thy holy name be worshipped and\nsanctified in the whole world. Thou wilt, in Thy\nown time, renew the world. Thou wilt awaken the\ndead and call them to a new life. Everlasting peace\nreigns in Thy kingdom. Give us and all Israel Thy\npeace. Amen.\n\n\u201c* Sleep soundly, little one, to whom no name had\nbeen given. He who knoweth His own will give you\na name; sleep soundly in the autumn night, no evil\nspirits will trouble you, although you never received\nthe holy water; rejoice that you are spared the\nbattle of life; you can dispense with its pleasures.\nCount yourself happy that you were permitted to\ngo, before you knew the world; pure and stainless\nyour soul left its delicate tenement; therefore we\nwill not throw earth on your coffin, for earth is an\nemblem of dissolution ; we will bed you in flowers,\nfor as a flower pierces the soil, so your soul shall rise\nfrom the dark grave to the light; from spirit you\ncame, to spirit you will return.\u201d\n", "Ile dropped his wreath into the little grave and\ncovered his head. Struve took a few steps towards\nhim, seized his hand, and shook it warmly; tears\nrolled down his cheeks, and he begged Levi for the\nloan of his handkerchief. Borg, after throwing his\nwreath into the grave, turned to go, and the others\nfollowed slowly.\n\nFalk stood gazing into the open grave, plunged in\ndeep thought. At first he saw only a square of\ndarkness; but gradually a bright spot appeared\nwhich grew and took shape; it looked like a dise\nand shone with the whiteness of a mirror\u2014it was\nthe blank shield on which the life of the child should\nhave been recorded. It gleamed brightly in the\ndarkness, reflecting the unbroken daylight. He\ndropped his wreath. There was a faint, dull thud,\nand the light went out. He turned and followed the\nothers.\n\nArrived at the coach, there was a brief discussion.\nBorg cut it short.\n\n\u201cTo the Restaurant Norrbacka!\u201d he - said,\nbriefly.\n\nA few minutes later the party was standing in the\nlarge room on the first floor; they were reecived\nby a girl whom Borg embraced and kissed; this\ndone, he pushed his hat underneath the sofa, com-\nmanded Levi to help him off with his overcoat, and\nordered a quart of punch, twenty-five cigars, half a\npint of brandy, and a sugar-loaf. T'inally he took off\nhis coat and sat down in shirt sleeves on the only sofa\nin the room,\n\nStruve\u2019s face beamed when he saw the preparations\nfor an orgy, and he shouted for music. Levi went to\nthe piano and strummed a waltz, while Struve put\nhis arm into Falk\u2019s and walked with him up and\ndown the room. He touched lightly on life in general,\non grief and joy, the inconstant nature of man, and so\non, all of which went to prove that it was a sin to\nmourn what the gods\u2014he said gods, because he had\n", "already said sin and did not wish to be taken for a\npietist\u2014had given and taken.\n\nThis reflexion was apparently made by way of an\nintroduction to the waltz which he immediately after\ndanced with the girl who brought the bowl.\n\nBorg filled the glasses, called Levi, nodded towards\na glass, and said :\n\n\u201c* Let\u2019s drink to our brotherly love now ; later on\nwe can be as rude as we like.\u201d\n\nLevi expressed. his appreciation of the honour.\n\n* Your healt Isaac !\u201d said Borg.\n\n** My name\u2019s not Isaac ! \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cWhat the dickens do I care what your name is ?\nI call you Isaac, my Isaac.\u201d\n\n\u201c You\u2019re a jolly devil . . .\u201d\n\n* Devil ! Siaine on you, Jew!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were going to be as rude as we liked . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cWe? I was, as far as you are concerned ! \u201d\n\nStruve thought he had better interfere.\n\n\u201cThank you, brother Levi, for your beautiful\nwords,\u201d he said. \u2018\u2018 What prayer was that ?\u201d\n\n\u201c* Our funeral prayer ! \u201d\n\n\u201cTt was beautiful ! \u201d\n\n\u201cNothing but empty words,\u201d interposed Borg.\n\u201cThe infidel dog prayed only for Israel; therefore\nthe prayer couldn\u2019t have been meant for the child.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll those who are not baptized are looked upon\nas belonging to Israel,\u201d\u2019 evlied Levi.\n\n\u201cAnd then you attacked baptism,\u201d continued\nBorg. \u201cI don\u2019t allow anybody to attack baptism\u2014\nwe can do that ourselves. And furthermore you\nattacked the doctrine of justification by faith. Leave\nit alone in future; I don\u2019t permit any outsiders to\nattack our religion.\u201d\n\n\u201cBorg\u2019s right there,\u201d said Struve; \u2018\u201c\u2018 we should\ndraw the line at attacking either baptism or any\nother of the sacred truths ; and I must beg of you\nnot to indulge in any frivolous discussion of these\nthings to-night.\u201d\n\n*\u201c You must beg of us?\u201d sneered Borg. \u2018* Must\n", "you really? All right! Ill forgive you if you'll\nhold your tongue. Play something, Isaac! Music !\nWhy is music mute at Cesar\u2019s feast ? Music! But\nnone of your old chestnuts! Play something\nnew!\u201d\n\nLevi went to the piano, and played the overture to\n** The Mute.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, let\u2019s talk,\u201d said Borg. \u2018\u2018 You are looking\ndepressed, Mr. Falk ; have a glass with me.\u201d\n\nFalk, who felt a certain embarrassment in Borg\u2019s\ncompany, accepted the offer with mental reserva-\ntions. But conversation languished, everybody\nseemed to dread a collision.\n\nStruve fluttered about like a moth in search of\npleasure, but unable to find it he again and again\nreturned to the punch-table ; every now and then\nhe danced a few steps, to keep up the fiction that\nthe meeting was merry and festive; but this was\nnot the case by any means.\n\nLevi see-sawed between piano and punch. He\nattempted to sing a cheerful song, but it was so stale\nthat nobody would listen to it.\n\nBorg talked at the top of his voice, \u201c\u2018 in order to\nraise his spirits,\u2019\u2019 as he said, but the party grew more\nand more silent, one might almost have said uneasy.\n\nFalk paced up and down the room, taciturn, por-\ntentous like a thundercloud.\n\nAt Borg\u2019s order a tremendous supper, a \u201c sexa \u201d\nwas served. The convives took their seats amidst\nominous silence. Struve and Borg drank immoderate\nquantities of brandy; in the face of the latter red\nspots appeared here and there, and the white of the\neyes looked yellow. But Struve resembled a var-\nnished Edam cheese; he was uniformly red and\ngreasy. Beside them Falk and Levi looked like\nchildren, eating their last supper in the society of\ngiants.\n\nBorg looked at Levi. \u2018\u2018 Hand the salmon to the\nseandal-monger,\u201d he commanded, in order to break\nthe monotonous silence.\n", "Levi handed the dish to Struve. The latter pushed\nhis spectacles on to his forehead and spat venom.\n\n=f Teens on you, Jew,\u201d\u2019 he foamed, throwing his\ndinner-napkin in Levi\u2019s face.\n\nBorg laid a heavy hand on Struve\u2019s bald pate.\n\n** Silence, you blackguard ! \u201d\u2019 he said.\n\n\u201cWhat dreadful company to be mixed up with!\nLet me tell you, gentlemen, I\u2019m too old to be treated\nlike a schoolboy,\u201d said Struve, tremulously, forgetting\nhis usual bonhomie.\n\nBorg, who had had enough to eat, rose from the\ntable.\n\n\u201cUgh !\u201d he said, \u201c\u2018 what a beastly crowd you are !\nPay, Isaac, I'll pay you back later on; I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\nHe put on his overeoat, put his hat on his head,\nfilled a tumbler with _ added brandy to it,\nemptied it at one gulp, blew out some of the candles\nin passing, smashed a few of the glasses, pocketed a\nhandful of cigars and a box of matches, and staggered\nout of the room.\n\n** What a pity that such a genius should drink like\nthat,\u201d said Levi solemnly.\n\nA moment later Borg re-entered the room, went to\nthe dining-table, took the candelabrum, lighted his\ncigar, blew the smoke into Struve\u2019s face, put out his\ntongue, showed his back teeth, extinguished the\nlights, and departed again. Levi rolled on the floor\nscreaming with laughter.\n\n\u201cTo what scum have you introduced me?\u201d asked\nFalk gravely.\n\n\u201cOh, my dear fellow, he\u2019s intoxicated to-night,\nbut he\u2019s the son of Professor Dr... . .\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cTI didn\u2019t ask who his father was, I asked who\nhe was,\u201d said Falk, cutting him short, \u2018I under-\nstand now why you allow such a dog to bully you ;\nbut can you tell me why he associates with\nyou?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT reserve my reply to all these futilities,\u201d\u2019 answered\nStruve stiffly.\n\n** Do reserve it, but reserve it for yourself ! \u201d\u2019\n", "\u2018\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you, brother Levi?\u201d\nasked Struve officiously ; \u2018\u2018 you look so grave.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great pity that a genius like Borg should\ndrink so much,\u201d\u2019 replied Levi.\n\n\u201d \" How and when does he show his genius ? \u201d asked\nalk.\n\n\u2018\u201cA man can be a genius without writing verse,\u201d\nsaid Struve pointedly.\n\n*\u201cT dare say ; writing verse does not pre-suppose\ngenius, nor is a2 man a genius if he behaves like a\nbrute,\u201d said Falk.\n\n\u2018\u201c* Hadn\u2019t we better pay and go ? \u201d remarked Struve,\nhurrying towards the door.\n\nFalk and Levi paid. When they stepped into the\nstreet it rained and the sky was black; only the\nreflexion of the gas-lit town faintly illuminated the\nsky. The coach had driven away ; there was nothing\nleft for them but to turn up their collars and walk.\n\nThey had gone as far as the skittle-alley, when\nthey were startled by terrible yells above their heads.\n\n\u201cCurse you!\u201d screamed a voice, and looking up\nthey saw Borg rocking himself on one of the highest\nbranches of a lime tree. The branch nearly touched\nthe ground, but at the next moment it described a\ntremendous curve upwards.\n\n\u201cOh!  Isn\u2019t it colossal!\u201d sereamed Levi.\n** Colossal !\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018What a madman,\u201d smiled Struve, proud of his\nprot\u00e9g\u00e9.\n\n\u201cCome along, Isaac!\u201d bellowed Borg, high up in\nthe air, \u201c\u2018 come along, Jew, let\u2019s borrow money from\ncach other ! \u201d )\n\n\u2018How much do you want ?\u201d asked Levi, waving\nhis pocket book.\n\n** T never borrow less than fifty ! \u201d\n\nAt the next moment Borg had slid to the ground\nand pocketed the note.\n\nThen he took off his overcoat.\n\n\u201cPut it on again immediately!\u201d commanded\nStruve.\n", "\u201cWhat do you say? I\u2019m to put it on again?\nWho are you to order me about ? What? Do you\nwant a fight ? \u201d\u2019\n\nHe smashed his hat against the tree, took off coat\nand waistcoat, and let the rain beat on his shirt.\n\n** Come here, you rascal! Let\u2019s have a fight ! \u201d\n\nHe seized Struve round the waist, and, staggering\nbackwards, both of them fell into the ditch.\n\nFalk hurried away as fast as he could. And for\na long time he could hear behind him outbursts of\nlaughter and shouts of bravo. He could distinguish\nLevi\u2019s voice yelling: \u2018\u2018 It\u2019s divine, it\u2019s colossal\u2014it\u2019s\ncolossal! *? And Borg\u2019s: \u2018\u2018 Traitor! Traitor!\u201d\n", "CHAPTER XX\nON THE ALTAR\n\nTue clock in the Townhall Vaults of X-k\u00e9ping\nthundered the seventh hour of an October evening\nas the manager of the Municipal Theatre came in.\nHe beamed as a toad may beam after a good meal ;\nhe looked happy, but his facial muscles, not ac-\ncustomed to express such emotions, drew the skin\ninto worried folds and disfigured him still more\nthan usual. He nodded patronizingly to the little\nshrivelled head-waiter who was standing behind,\nthe bar counting the guests.\n\n\u201cWell, and how\u2019s the world treating you?\u201d\nscreamed the manager in German\u2014he had dropped the\nhabit of speaking long ago.\n\n\u201cThank you!\u201d replied the head-waiter in the\nsame language, and as this was all the German the\ntwo gentlemen knew, the conversation was continued\nin Swedish.\n\n\u201cWell, what do you think of the lad Gustav ?\nWasn\u2019t his Don Diego excellent ? Don\u2019t you admit\nthat I can make actors? What?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cThere\u2019s no denying that! Fancy, that boy!\nIt\u2019s quite true what you said, sir. It\u2019s easier to do\nsomething with a man who hasn\u2019t been ruined\nby book-learning.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cBooks arc the ruin of a good many 2858 No-\nbody knows that better than I do. Towever, do\nyou know anything about books? I do! You\nwill sce queer things when young Rehnhjelm plays\nHoratio! Dve promised him the part, because\nhe gave me no peace; but I\u2019ve also warned him\n\n226\n", "not to look to me forany assistance. I don\u2019t want to\nbe held responsible for his failure; I also told him\nthat I was allowing him to play the part to show\nhim how difficult it is to act when one has no talent.\nOh! He shall have such a snub that he'll never look\nat a part again. See if he won\u2019t! But that isn\u2019t\nwhat I want to say to you!

You\u2019d\nbetter do the waiting yourself.\u201d\n\nHe did not shout the last few words; the head-\nwaiter bowed; he had understood.\n\nAt this moment Falander entered the room. He\ntook his accustomed seat without as much as a loo\nat the manager. \u2018The latter rose immediately. \u2018\u201c* At\neight then,\u2019\u2019 he whispered, as he passed the bar and\nwent out.\n\nThe head-waiter brought Falander a bottle of\nabsinth, and all the wold trimmings. As the actor\nseemed disinclined to enter into conversation, the\nhead-waiter wiped the table with his napkin; when\nthat was no good, he refilled the match-stand, and\nsaid :\n\n** Supper to-night, the small rooms! Hm!\u201d\n\n** Of whom and of what are you talking ? \u201d\n\n\u201cOf him who\u2019s just gone out.\u201d\n\n\u201cT see! But that\u2019s unusual, he\u2019s generally so\nmean. Supper for one?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor two,\u201d replied the head-waiter, winking.\n\u00ab* In the small rooms, hm! \u201d\u2019\n\nFalander pricked up his ears, but at the same time\nhe felt ashamed to be listening to gossip and dropped\nthe subject ; but that was not what the head-waiter\nwanted.\n\n*\u201c*T wonder who itis? His wife is ill, and. . .\u201d\n\n*\u201c What does it matterto us ? Let the monster sup\nwith whom he likes ! Have you an evening paper?\u201d\n", "The head-waiter was saved a reply. Rehnhjelm\nwas approaching the table, radiant, like a man who\nsees a ray of light on his path.\n\n\u201c* Leave the absinth alone to-night,\u2019\u2019 he said, \u2018\u2018 and\nbe my guest. Iam happy, I could ery.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has happened ?\u201d asked Falander uneasily.\n** Surely, he hasn\u2019t given you a part ?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has, you _ pessimist !

How\ncan you\u2014as long as you look upon all paltry creations\nof man as great and splendid\u2014strive after the\neternal? If you see perfection and excellence in\neverything here below, how can you yearn for the\nreally perfect ? Believe me, pessimism is the truest\nidealism! It is a Christian doctrine too, if that will\nsalve your conscience, for Christianity teaches us\nthat the world is a vale of tears from which death\nwill deliver us!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you let me believe that the world is beauti-\nful? Can\u2019t you let me be grateful to Him who is the\n", "giver of all good things, and rejoice in the happiness\nlife has to offer ?\u201d\n\n\u2018**Yes, yes, my boy, rejoice, rejoice and believe\nand hope!

She may make good use of the rare\nchance and get as much out of the part as most\nactresses do. Iam sorry I made you feel sad; don\u2019t\nbelieve what I said; after all, who knows whether\nI am right or wrong ?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* Tf I didn\u2019t know you better, I might believe you\nthat you\u2019re jealous.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, my boy; nothing would please me more\nthan to see yours and all men\u2019s wishes speedily\nfulfilled ; then the thoughts of men might turn to\nhigher things.

He sat\nup in bed and listened\u2014there was not a sound. He\ndrew up the blind and looked out on a grey autumn\nmorning, windy and rainy. He went back to bed\nand tried to sleep, but in vain. There were strange\nvoices in the wind; they moaned and warned and\nwept and whimpered. He tried to think of something\nseat of his happiness. He took his part and\n\ngan to learn it; it seemed to be nothing but\nyes, my prince; he thought of Falander\u2019s words and\ncould not help admitting that he was to some extent\nright. He tried to picture himself on the stage as\nHoratio; he tried to picture Agnes in the part of\nOphelia, and could see in her nothing but a hypo-\ncritical schemer, spreading nets for Hamlet at\nPolonius\u2019s advice. He attempted to drive away the\nthought, and instead of Agnes he saw the coquettish\nMiss Jacquette, who had been the last to play the part\nat the Municipal Theatre.\n\nHe tried in vain to drive away these disagreeable\nfancies; they followed him like gnats. At last,\nexhausted with the strain, he fell asleep, but only\nto suffer the same torment in his dream; he roused\nhimself with an effort, but soon dropped off to sleep\nagain, and immediately the same visions disturbed\nhim. About nine o\u2019clock he awoke with a scream,\nand jumped out of bed as if he were fleeing from evil\nspirits. When he looked into the glass he saw that\nhis eyes were red with weeping. He dressed hastily\n\n232\n", "and as he picked up his boot, a big spider ran across\nthe floor. The sight pleased him for he believed in\nthe superstition that a spider is a harbinger of happi-\nness ; his good-humour was restored and he came to\nthe conclusion that if a man wanted an undisturbed\nnight\u2019s rest, he should avoid crabs for supper. He\ndrank his coffee and smoked a pipe and smiled at the\nrain-showers and the wind. A knock at the door\naroused him from his reverie; he started, for he was\nafraid of news, he-could not tell why ; but he thought\nof the spider and calmly opened the door.\n\nA servant handed him a letter from Falander,\nbegging him to come to his rooms at ten, on very\nimportant business.\n\nAgain he was assailed by the indescribable feeling\nof fear which had troubled his morning slumber ;\nhe tried to while away the time until ten. It was\nimpossible; he dressed and went to Falander\u2019s\nhouse.\n\nThe latter had risen early ; his room had been put\nstraight and he was ready to receive his friend. He\ngreeted Rehnhjelm cordially, but with unusual\ngravity. Rehnhjelm overwhelmed him with ques-\ntions, but Falander refused to reply before ten o\u2019clock.\nRehnhjelm\u2019s anxiety grew and he wanted to know\nwhether there was unpleasant news ; Falander replied\nthat nothing on earth was unpleasant as long as one\nlooked at things in the right light. And he declared\nthat many so-called unbearable situations could be\nborne quite easily if only one did not exaggerate\ntheir importance.\n\nThe time ee slowly, but at last it struck ten.\nA gentle double-rap at the door relieved the tension.\nFalander opened at once and admitted Agnes.\nWithout a look at those present she drew the key from\nthe lock, and locked the door from the inside. A\nmomentary embarrassment seized her when, on turn-\ning round, she was confronted by two men instead of\nonly one, but her embarrassment gave way to pleasant\nsurprise when she recognized Rehnhjelm. Throwing\n", "off her water-proof, she ran towards him; he took\nher in his arms and passionately pressed her to his\nheart, as if he had not seen her for a year.\n\n** You\u2019ve been away a long time, Agnes ! \u201d\n\n\u201cA long time ? What do you mean ?\u201d\n\n\u201c* T feel as if I hadn\u2019t seen you for a life-time. How\nsplendid you are looking! Did you sleep well ?\u201d\n\n** Do you think I look better than usual ? \u201d\n\n\u201cYes! You are flushed and there are little dimples\nin your cheeks! Won\u2019t you say good morning to\nFalander ? \u201d\n\nThe latter stood quietly listening to the conver-\nsation, but his face was deadly white and he seemed to\nbe absorbed in thought.\n\n\u201cHow worn you are looking,\u201d said Agnes, crossing\nthe room with the graceful movements of a kitten, as\nRehnhjelm released her from his arms.\n\nFalander made noreply. Agnes looked at him more\nkeenly, and all at once became aware of his thoughts.\nA fleeting expression of trouble passed across her face,\nas the surface of a pond is rippled by the breeze ; but\nshe immediately regained her usual serenity, glanced\nat Rehnhjelm, realized the situation, and was prepared\nfor anything.\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cMay we be told what important business has\nbrought us together here, at this early hour ?\u201d she\nasked gaily, putting her hand on Falander\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cCertainly,\u201d said the latter, with such firm\nresolution that her face paled; but at the same\nmoment he threw back his head, as if he wanted to\nforce his thoughts into another groove, \u201cit\u2019s my\nbirthday, and I want you to have breakfast with me.\u201d\n\nAgnes, who had seen the train rushing straight at\nher, felt relieved ; she burst into merry laughter and\nembraced Falander.\n\n** But as breakfast has been ordered for eleven, we'll\nhave to wait a while. Won\u2019t you sit down?\u201d\n\nThere was an ominous silence.\n\n\u201cAn angel is passing through the room,\u201d said\nAgnes.\n", "\u201cYou ! \u201d said Rehnhjelm, respectfully and ardently\nkissing her hand.\n\nFalander looked as if he had been thrown out of\nhis saddle, and was making violent efforts to regain\ni\n\n\u201cT saw a spider this morning,\u201d said Rehnhjelm,\n\u201cthat predicts happiness.\u201d\n\n** Araign\u00e9e matin : chagrin,\u201d said Falander. \u2018\u2018 Have\nyou never heard that ?\u201d\u2019\n\n** What does that mean ?\u201d\u2019 asked Agnes.\n\n\u2018*\u2018 A spider on the morrow: grief and sorrow.\u201d\n\noe Hm ! 23\n\nAgain they grew silent. The only sound which\ndisturbed the stillness was the sound of the rain\nbeating in gusts against the windows.\n\n**T read an awfully tragic book last night,\u201d\ney remarked Falander. \u201c\u2018I hardly slept a\nwink.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat book was that?\u201d asked Rehnhjelm,\nwithout betraying very much interest.\n\n\u201c\u201cTts title was \u2018 Pierre Cl\u00e9ment,\u2019 and its subject\nthe usual woman\u2019s game. But it was told so well\nthat it made a great impression on me.\u201d\n\n**May I ask what the usual woman\u2019s game is ?\u201d\nsaid Agnes.\n\n**Faithlessness and treachery !\u201d\n\n** And this Pierre Cl\u00e9ment ? \u201d\n\n\u201cHe was, of course, betrayed. He was a young\nartist, in love with another man\u2019s mistress . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT remember the book; I liked it very much.\nWasn\u2019t she later on engaged to a man whom she really\nloved ? Yes, that was it, and during all the time she\nkept up her old liaison. The author wanted to show\nthat a woman can love in two ways; a man only in\none. That\u2019s true enough, isn\u2019t it ?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly! But the day came when her fianc\u00e9\nwas going to compete with a picture. To cut my\ntale short, she gave herself to the president, and\nPierre Cl\u00e9ment was happy and could be married.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c And by this the author wanted to show that a\n", "woman will sacrifice everything to the man she loves\u2014\na man, on the other hand . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is the most infamous statement I ever\nheard ! \u201d burst out Falander.\n\nHe rose, went to his writing-desk, threw open the\nflap and took out a black box.\n\n** Here,\u201d he said, handing it to Agnes; \u2018\u2018 go home\nand rid the world of a monster.\u201d\n\n** What\u2019s that ?\u201d\u2019 laughed Agnes, opening the box\nand taking out a six-barrelled revolver. \u2018I say,\nwhat a sweet thing! Didn\u2019t you use this as Carl\nMoor? I believe it is loaded.\u201d\n\nShe raised the revolver and fired up the chimney.\n\n** Lock it up,\u201d\u2019 she said, \u2018\u2018 this is no toy, my friends.\u201d\n\nRehnhjelm had watched the scene speechlessly.\nHe understood the meaning well enough, but he was\nunable to say a word; and he was so much under\nthe girl\u2019s spell, that he could not even feel angry with\nher. He realized that he had been stabbed, but he\nhad as yet not had time to feel the pain.\n\nThe girl\u2019s impudence disconcerted Falander ; he\nwanted time to recover ; his moral execution had been\na complete failure, and his coup de th\u00e9dtre had been\ndisastrous to himself.\n\n**Hadn\u2019t we better go now?\u201d asked Agnes,\nstraightening her hat before the glass.\n\nFalander opened the door.\n\n\u2018*Go and be damned to you!\u201d he said. \u2018\u201c* You\nhave ruined an honest man\u2019s peace of mind.\u201d\n\n** What are you talking about ? Shut the door!\nIt\u2019s none too warm here.\u201d\n\n**T see, I have to speak more plainly. Where were\nyou last night ?\u201d\n\n\u2018* Hjalmar knows, and it\u2019s no business of yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were not at your aunt\u2019s! You had supper\nwith the manager ! \u201d\n\n** It\u2019s a lie!\u201d\n\n\u2018** T saw you at nine in the vaults of the Town-hall.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cT say it\u2019s a lie! I was at home at that time!\nGo and ask aunt\u2019s maid who saw me home.\u201d\n", "\u2018**T should never have expected this from you!\u201d\n\n**Hadn\u2019t we better stop talking nonsense now and\nbe off ? You shouldn\u2019t read stupid books all night ;\nthen you wouldn\u2019t be in a bad temper on the next\nday. Put on your hats and come.\u201d\n\nRehnhjelm put his hand to his head to feel whether\nit was in its accustomed place, for everything seemed\nto him to be turned upside down. When he found\nthat it was still there, he attempted to come to a\nclear understanding of the matter, but he was unable\nto do so.\n\n\u201cWhere were you on the sixth of July?\u201d asked\nFalander, with the sternness of a judge.\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cWhat an idiotic question to ask! How can I\nremember what happened three months ago ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were with me, but you told Hjalmar you\nwere with your aunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t listen to him,\u201d said Agnes, going up to\nRehnhjelm and caressing him. \u2018\u2018 He\u2019s talking non-\nsense.\u201d\n\nRehnhjelm\u2019s hand shot out ; he seized her by the\nthroat and flung her on her back behind the stove,\nwhere she fell on a little pile of wood and remained\nlying still and motionless.\n\nHe put on his hat, but Falander had to help him\nwith his coat, for he trembled violently.\n\n\u201cCome along, let\u2019s be off,\u201d he said, spitting on the\nhearthstone.\n\nFalander hesitated for a moment, felt Agnes\u2019 pulse\nand then followed Rehnhjelm with whom he caught\nup in the lower hall.\n\n\u201c\u201cT admire you!\u201d he said; \u2018\u2018 the matter was really\nbeyond discussion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen let it for ever remain so! We haven\u2019t\nmuch time to enjoy each other\u2019s company. I am\nleaving for home by the next train, to work and to\nforget! Let\u2019s go to the vaults now.\u201d\n\nThey went to the vaults and engaged a private\nroom, where breakfast was served to them.\n\n\u201c\u201cHas my hair turned grey ?\u201d asked Rehnhjelm,\n", "passing his hand over his hair which was damp and\nclung closely to his skull.\n\n\u2018No, old man, that doesn\u2019t often happen; even\nI\u2019m not grey.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cTs she hurt ?\u201d\n\noe No ! 2?\n\n\u201c* It was in this room\u2014I met her for the first time.\u201d\n\nHe rose from the table, staggered to the sofa, and\nthrew himself on his knees by the side of it. Burying\nhis head in the cushions, he burst into tears like a\nchild crying in his mother\u2019s lap.\n\nFalander took his head in both his hands, and\nRehnhjelm felt something hot and scalding dropping\non his neck.\n\n\u2018* Where\u2019s your philosophy now, old fellow? Out\nwith it! Pm drowning! Give me a straw to clutch\nat!\u201d '\n\n\u201cPoor boy! poor old boy!\u201d\n\n**T must see her! I must ask her forgiveness! I\nlove her in spite of it! In spite of it! Are you sure\nshe isn\u2019t hurt ? Oh! my God, that one can be so\nunhappy and yet not die!\u201d\n\nAt three o\u2019clock in the afternoon Rehnhjelm left\nfor Stockholm. Falander slammed the carriage door\nbehind him and turned the handle.\n", "CHAPTER XXII\nHARD TIMES\n\nTo Sell\u00e9n also the autumn had brought great changes.\nHis powerful patron had died, and all memory of him\nwas to be blotted out ; even the memories of his kind\nactions were not to survive him. That Sell\u00e9n\u2019s\nstipend was stopped went without saying, especially\nas the artist could not bring himself to petition for\nits continuance. He did not believe that he required\nfurther assistance, after having been given a helping\nhand once, and, moreover, there were so many younger\nmembers of his profession in greater need of it.\n\nBut he was made to realize that not only was the\nsun extinguished but that the smaller planets, too,\nsuffered from total eclipse. He had worked strenu-\nously during the summer and had made great progress\nin his art, but nevertheless the president declared that\nit had deteriorated, and that his success in the spring\nhad been nothing more than a stroke of luck; the\nprofessor of landscape-painting had told him as a\nfriend that he would never be a great artist, and the\nacademician had seized the opportunity to rehabilitate\nhimself, and clung to his first opinion. In addition\nto this the public taste in pictures had changed; the\nignorant wealthy handful of people who were in the\nhabit of buying pictures and therefore set the fashion,\ndid not want landscapes, but portraits of the watering-\nplaces and summer resorts they knew; and it was\ndifficult to sell even these ; the only demand was for\nsentimental genre-pictures and half-nude figures.\n\nTherefore Sell\u00e9n had fallen on evil days, for he\ncould not bring himself to paint against his better\n\n239\n", "judgment. He was now renting a former photo-\ngraphic studio on the top of a house in Government\nStreet. The accommodation consisted of the studio\nitself, with its rotten floor and leaking roof\u2014the latter\ndefect was not felt at present, for it was winter and\nthe roof was covered with snow\u2014and the old dark-\nroom which smelt of collodium, and for this reason\ncould only be used as a wood- or coal-shed, when\ncircumstances permitted the purchase of fuel. The\nonly piece of furniture was a wooden garden seat,\nstudded with protruding nails. It was so short that\na man using it as a bed\u2014and it was always used as\na bed when the owner, or rather the borrower, spent\nthe night at home\u2014had either to draw his knees up\nto his chin, or allow his legs to dangle over the side.\nThe bedding consisted of half a rug\u2014the other half\nwas at the pawnbroker\u2019s\u2014and a leather case, stuffed\nto bursting-point with studies and sketches.\n\nIn the dark-room was a water tap and a basin with\na waste pipe\u2014the only substitute for a dressing-table.\n\nOn a cold afternoon, a short time before Christmas,\nSell\u00e9n was standing before his easel, painting for the\nthird time a new picture on an old canvas. He had\njust risen from his hard bed; no servant had come\nin to light his fire\u2014partly because he had no servant,\nand partly because he had nothing with which to\nmake a fire\u2014no servant had brushed his clothes\nor brought his coffee. And yet he was standing\nbefore his ease] whistling merrily, engaged in paint-\ning a brilliant sunset, when there came four knocks\nat the door. Sell\u00e9n opened without hesitation and\nadmitted Olle Montanus, very plainly and very lightly\nclad, without an overcoat.\n\n**Good morning, Olle! How are you? Did you\nsleep well ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks.\u201d\n\n\u2018** How\u2019s the cash-box ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Bad!\u201d\n\n** And the notes ?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u00ab'There are so few in circulation.\u201d\n", "\u201cIT see! They won't issue any more\u2019 And the\nvaluables ?\n\n\u201cThere aren\u2019t any.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s going to be a hard winter ?\u201d\n\n\u201cTI. saw a great many chatterers this morning ;\nthat means a hard winter.\u201d\n\n** You took a morning stroll ?\u201d\n\n\u201cT\u2019ve walked about all night, after leaving the\nRed Room at midnight.\u201d\n\n** You were at the Red Room last night ? \u201d\n\n\u201cYes; and I made two new acquaintances: Dr.\nBorg and a man called Levin.\u201d\n\n\u2018Oh! Those rascals! I know them! Why didn\u2019t\nyou spend the night with them ?\u201d\n\n\u2018** They turned up their noses at me because I had\nno overcoat, and I felt ashamed. But I am worn\nout; I'll rest for a few moments on your sofa! I\u2019ve\nwalked through the whole town and round half of\nit ; I must try and get work to-day at a stone-mason\u2019s\nor I shall starve.\u201d\n\n\u201c* Is it true that you are a member of the Workmen\u2019s\nUnion \u2018 Star of the North\u2019 ?\u201d\n\n** Quite true ; I\u2019m going to lecture there on Sunday\nnext, on Sweden.\u201d\n\n\u201cA good subject! Plenty to say!\u201d\n\n\u201cTf I should fall asleep on your sofa, don\u2019t waken\nme; I\u2019m dead-beat.\u201d\n\n** All right, old chap! Go to sleep!\u201d\n\nA few moments later Olle was fast asleep and snoring\nloudly. His head was hanging over one of the side-\nrailings which supported his thick neck, and his legs\nover the other.\n\n** Poor devil !\u2019\u2019 muttered Sell\u00e9n, covering him up\nwith his rug.\n\nThere was another knock, but as it was) unfamiliar\nSell\u00e9n judged it wise to take no notice of it ; thereupon\nthe clamour became so furious that it dissipated his\napprehensions and he opened the door to Dr. \u2018Day and\nLevin. Borg was the first to speak.\n\n**Ts Falk here ?\u201d\n", "a No ! \u201d\n\n* Who is that sack of wood over there ? \u201d\u2019 continued\nBorg, pointing at Olle with his snow-boot.\n\n\u201cOlle Montanus.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! That extraordinary fellow who was with\nFalk last night ! Is he asleep ?\u201d\n\noe Yes.\u201d\n\n** Did he spend the night here ? \u201d\n\nae Yes.\u201d\n\n*\u201c Why haven\u2019t you a fire? It\u2019s beastly cold.\u201d\n\n\u2018* Because I have no wood.\u201d\n\n** Send for some then! Where\u2019s the servant? I'll\nmake her trot.\u201d\n\n\u2018* Gone to early service.\u201d\n\n\u2018*Wake up that sleeping ox over there and send\nhim!\u201d\n\n\u2018No, let him sleep,\u201d\u2019 objected Sell\u00e9n, covering up\nOlle, who was still snoring loudly.\n\n\u2018** Then I must show you another way. What\u2019s the\nfloor-packing ? Earth or rubbish ?\u201d\n\n** f don\u2019t understand these matters,\u201d replied Sell\u00e9n,\ncarefully stepping on some sheets of cardboard which\nwere lying on the floor.\n\n\u2018* Have you got another piece of cardboard ? \u201d\n\n** What are you driving at ? \u201d asked Sell\u00e9n, colouring\nup to the roots of his hair.\n\n\u2018* T want it, and a pair of fire-tongs.\u201d\u2019\n\nSell\u00e9n gave him the required articles, took his\nsketching stool and sat down on the pieces of cardboard\nas if he were guarding a treasure.\n\nBorg took off his coat, and with the help of the\nfire-tongs loosened a board in the floor, rotted by rain\nand acids.\n\n\u2018**Confound you ! What are you doing ? \u201d exclaimed\nSell\u00e9n. :\n\n\u2018**T used to do this in my college days at Upsala,\u201d\nsaid Borg.\n\n\u2018\u201c* But you can\u2019t do that sort of thing at Stock-\nholm!\u201d\n\n\u201cHang it all, \u2019mecold! I must have a fire.\u201d\n", "\u201c* But there\u2019s no necessity to break up the floor in\nthe middle of the room! It shows too much ! \u201d\n\n** What does that matter tome! I don\u2019t live here.\nBut this is too hard.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile he had approached Sell\u00e9n, and all of a\nsudden he pushed him and the stool over; in falling\nthe artist dragged the pieces of cardboard with him,\nexposing the bare floor-packing underneath.\n\n*Miscreant! To have a perfect timber-yard and\nnot to say a word about it !\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rain\u2019s done it ! \u201d\n\n\u201c*T don\u2019t care who\u2019s done it! Let\u2019s light a fire!\u201d\n\nHe wrenched off a few pieces of wood with his strong\nhands and soon a fire was blazing in the grate.\n\nLevin had watched the scene, quiet, neutral, and\npolite. Borg sat down before the fire and made the\ntongs red-hot.\n\nAgain there was a knock: three short raps and a\nlonger one.\n\n\u201c\u201c'That\u2019s Falk,\u201d said Sell\u00e9n, opening the door.\n\nFalk entered, looking a little hectic.\n\n\u201cDo you want money ?\u201d said Borg to the new:\ncomer, laying his hand on his apes See\n\n\u201c\u201cWhat a question to ask,\u201d said Falk, looking at\nhim doubtfully.\n\n\u201cHow much do you want ? I can let you have it.\u201d\n\n\u201c Are you serious ?\u201d\u2019 asked Falk, and his face cleared.\n\n\u201cSerious? Hm! How much? The figure! The\namount !\u201d\n\n*\u201c\u201cT could do with, say, sixty crowns.\u201d\n\n\u201c* Good Lord, how modest you are,\u201d remarked Borg,\nand turned to Levin.\n\n\u201cYes, it is very little,\u2019 said the latter. \u2018\u201c\u2018 Take as\nmuch as you can get Falk while the purse is open.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT\u2019d rather not! Sixty crowns is all I want, and\nI can\u2019t afford to take up a bigger loan. But how is it\nto be paid back ?\u201d\n\n\u201cTwelve crowns every sixth month, twenty-four\ncrowns per annum, in two instalments,\u201d said Levin\npromptly and firmly,\n", "\u201c\u201c Those are easy terms,\u201d replied Falk. \u2018\u2018 Where do\nyou get money on those terms ?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom the Wheelwrights\u2019 Bank. Give me paper\nand a pen, Levin!\u201d\n\nQuick as lightning Levin produced a promissory\nnote, a pen, and a pocket inkstand. The note had\nalready been filled up by the others. When Falk saw\nthe figure eight hundred he hesitated for a moment.\n\n** ight hundred crowns ?\u201d\u2019 he asked.\n\n** You can have more if you are not satisfied.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cNo, I won\u2019t; it\u2019s all the same who takes the\nmoney as long as it is paid up allright. But can you\nraise money on a bill of this sort, without security ? \u201d\n\n\u2018** Without security ? You are forgetting that we\nare guaranteeing it,\u201d replied Levin, with contemptuous\nfamiliarity.\n\n\u201c\u201cT don\u2019t want to depreciate it,\u201d observed Falk.\n\u201c*T\u2019m grateful for your guarantees, but I don\u2019t believe\nthat the bill will be accepted.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, won\u2019t it! It\u2019s accepted already,\u201d said Borg,\nbringing out a bill of acceptance, as he called it. \u2018\u2018 Go\non, Falk, sign!\u201d\n\nFalk signed his name.\n\nBorg and Levin were watching him, looking over his\nshoulders like policemen.\n\n\u201c* Assessor,\u201d\u2019 dictated Borg.\n\n**No, I\u2019m a journalist,\u201d objected Falk.\n\n\u2018*That\u2019s no good; you are registered as assessor,\nand as such you still figure in the directory.\u201d\n\n\u201c* Did you look it up ?\u201d\n\n**One should be correct in matters of form,\u201d said\nBorg gravely.\n\nFalk signed.\n\n\u201cCome here, Sell\u00e9n, and witness,\u201d\u201d commanded Borg.\n\n\u2018\u201c*T don\u2019t know whether I ought to,\u201d replied Sell\u00e9n,\n**T\u2019ve seen at home, in the country, so much misery\narising from such signatures . . .\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cYou are not in the country now, and you are\nnot dealing with peasants. There\u2019s no reason why\nyou shouldn\u2019t witness that Falk\u2019s signature is genuine.\u201d\n", "Sell\u00e9n signed, shaking his head.\n\n** And now rouse that draught-ox over there and\nmake him, too, witness the signature.\u201d\n\nWhen all shaking was in vain Borg took the tongs,\nwhich: were now red-hot, and held them under the\nsleeper\u2019s nostrils.\n\n\u2018** Wake up, you dog, and you shall have something\nto eat!\u201d\n\nOlle jumped up and rubbed his eyes.\n\n\u201cYou are to witness Falk\u2019s signature.

He was a\nlittle changed ; time had thinned his fair hair, and the\npassions had delved little channels in his face, for the\nacids which the parched soil distilled. He was stoop-\ning over a little book of the shape and size of the\nCatechism, and his busy pen seemed to prick out\ndesigns.\n\nThere was a knock at the door; immediately the\nbook disappeared beneath the flap of his writing-desk,\nand was replaced by the morning pr.

Someday Ishallsmashhim. \u2018The rascal\u2019s\ndeceitful.\u201d\n\nHe arranged his tie, pulled out his cuffs and opened\nthe door leading to a little waiting-room.\n\n\u201cAh! Good morning, Mr. Lundell! Very glad\ntosee you! Pleasecomein! Howare you? Ihad\nlocked my door for a few moments.\u201d\n\nIt really was Lundell; Lundell dressed in the\n", "height of fashion like a shop assistant; he wore a\nwatch-chain, rings, gloves and overshoes.\n\n\u201cTIT am not calling at an inconvenient time, I\nhope ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all! Do you think, Mr. Lundell, that you\nwill be able to finish it by to-morrow ? \u201d\n\n** Must it be finished by to-morrow ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt absolutely must! It will be a red-letter day\nfor the cr\u00e9che to-morrow; Mrs. Falk will publicly\npresent my portrait to the institution, to be hung in\nthe dining-room.\u201d\n\n**'Then we must not let any obstacles stand in our\nway,\u201d replied Lundell, taking an easel and an almost\nfinished canvas from a cupboard. \u201cIf you will sit\nto me for a few moments, sir, I will give the picture\nthe finishing touches.\u201d\n\n** With all the pleasure in the world.\u201d\n\nFalk sat down in a chair, crossed his legs, threw\nhimself into the attitude of a statesman and tried to\nlook aristocratic.\n\n**Won\u2019t you talk, sir? Although your face is an\nexceedingly interesting one when at rest, yet the more\ncharacteristics I can bring out, the better.\u201d\n\nFalk smirked ; a glimmer of pleasure and gratifica-\ntion lit up his coarse features.\n\n\u201c\u201cT hope you'll be able to dine with us on bank\nholiday, Mr. Lundell ?\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you... .\u201d\n\n\u201c* You'll be able to study the faces of many men of\ndistinction, then, men whose features deserve being\nfixed on canvas far more than mine do.\u201d\n\n\u2018**Perhaps I may have the honour of painting\nthem ?\u201d\n\n** You will, if I recommend you.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* Oh, do you really think so ?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* Certainly I do!\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c JT just caught a new expression in your face. Try\nand keep it for a few moments. There! This is\nexcellent !_ I\u2019m afraid I shall have to work at this\nportrait all day long. There are so many details\n", "which one only discovers gradually. Your face is rich\nin interesting features.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that case we had better dine together! We\nmust see a good deal of each other, Mr. Lundell, so\nthat\u2019 you may have an opportunity of studying my\nface for a second edition, which it is always well to\nhave. Really, I must say, there are few people to\nwhom I felt so strongly drawn from the first moment,\nas I did to you, Mr. Lundell.\u201d\n\n**Oh, my dear sir!\u201d\n\n** And let me tell you that my eyes are keen and\nwell able to distinguish truth from flattery.\u201d\n\n\u2018**T knew that from the first,\u201d answered Lundell\nunscrupulously. \u2018My profession has given me an\ninsight into human character.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a very keen observer indeed. Not\neverybody understands me. My wife, for in-\nStance .. .\u201d\n\n*\u201cOh! Women cannot be expected . . .\u201d\n\n**No, that wasn\u2019t altogether what I meant. But\nmay I offer you a glass a good old port ?\u201d\n\n\u201c Thank you, sir; I never drink when I\u2019m working,\non principle. eee\n\n* Quite right! I respect this principle\u2014I always\nrespect principles\u2014all the more because I share it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut when I\u2019m not at work, I enjoy a glass.\u201d\n\n** Just as I do.\u201d\n\nIt struck half-past twelve. Falk rose.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, Peet leave you for a short time, on\nbusiness. I shall be back almost immediately.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018 Certainly, business first.\u201d\n\nFalk put on his hat and coat and went. Lundell\nwas left alone.\n\nHe lit a cigar and studied the portrait. No\nobserver, however keen, could have guessed his\nthoughts ; he had acquired sufficient knowledge of\nthe art of life to hide his opinions even when he was\nalone ; nay, more than that, he was afraid of coming\nto a clear understanding with himself.\n", "CHAPTER XXIV\n\nON SWEDEN\nTuey had arrived at the dessert. The champagne\nsparkled in the glasses which reflected the rays of\nlight from the chandelier in Nicholas Falk\u2019s dining-\nroom. Arvid was greeted on all sides with friendly\nhand-shakes, compliments and congratulations, warn-\nings and advice; everybody wanted to be present\nand share in his triumph, for he had had a decided\nsuccess.\n\n* Assessor Falk! I\u2019m delighted!\u201d said the Presi-\ndent of the Board of Payment of Employ\u00e9s\u2019 Salaries,\nnodding to him across the table. \u201c\u2018I fully appreciate\nyour talent.\u201d\n\nArvid tranquilly pocketed the insulting compliment.\n\n\u2018\u201c Why are your poems so melancholy ? \u201d asked a\nyoung beauty on the poet\u2019s right. \u2018\u2018 One might almost\nthink you were suffering from an unhappy love-\naffair.\u2019\n\n\u201c* Assessor Falk, allow me to drink your health,\u201d\nsaid the chief editor of the Grey Bonnet, from the left,\nstroking his long, blond beard. \u2018\u2018 Why don\u2019t you\nwrite for my paper ?\u201d\n\n**T shouldn\u2019t think you would print my articles,\u201d\nreplied Arvid.\n\n**T don\u2019t see why we shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* Our opinions differ so very widely . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! That isn\u2019t half as bad as you think. One\ncompromises. We have no opinions.\u201d\n\n\u201c*Vour health, Falk!\u2019 shouted the excited Lundell,\nfrom the other side of the table. \u2018* Your health ! \u201d\n\nLevi and Borg had to hold him, otherwise he would\n\n254\n", "have risen and made a speech. It was for the first\ntime that Lundell was invited to a dinner of this sort,\nand the brilliant assembly and luxurious food and\ndrink intoxicated him; but as all the guests were\nmore: or less merry, he fortunately excited no un-\npleasant attention.\n\nArvid Falk\u2019s heart beat faster at the sight of all\nthese people who had readmitted him to their circle\nwithout asking for explanations or apologies. It gave\nhim a sense of security to sit on those old chairs, which\nhad been a part of the home of his childhood. With\na feeling of melancholy he recognized the tall table-\ncentre which in the old times had only seen daylight\nonce a year. But the number of new people dis- -\ntracted him ; their friendly faces did not deceive him;\ncertainly they did not wish him evil, but their friend-\nship depended on a combination of circumstances.\n\nMoreover, he saw the whole entertainment in the\nlight of a masquerade. What mutual interest could\npossibly form a bond between his uncultured brother\nand Professor Borg, the man with the great scientific\nreputation ? They were shareholders in the same\ncompany ! What was the proud Captain Gyllenborst\ndoing here ? Had he come for the sake of the dinner ?\nImpossible, even though a man will go a long way for\nthe sake of a good dinner. And the President ? The\nAdmiral ? There must have been invisible ties, strong,\nunbreakable ties perhaps.\n\nThe mirth a, but the laughter was too\nshrill; the lips were overflowing with wit, but the\nwit was biting. Falk felt ill at ease; it seemed to\nhim that his father\u2019s eyes were looking angrily at the\nassembly from the painted canvas which hung over\nthe piano.\n\nNicholas Falk beamed with satisfaction; he neither\nsaw nor heard any unpleasantness, but he avoided\nmeeting his brother\u2019s eyes as much as possible. They\nhad not spoken to each other yet, for Arvid, in com-\npliance with Levin\u2019s instructions, had not arrived\nuntil after all the guests had been_assembled.\n", "The dinner was approaching its end. Nicholas\nmade a speech on \u201c the stamina and firm resolution \u201d\nwhich are necessary to accomplish a man\u2019s purpose :\nthe achievement of financial independence and a good\nsocial position, \u2018These two qualities,\u2019 said the\nspeaker, \u201c raise a man\u2019s self-respect and endow him\nwith that firmness without which his efforts are\nunavailing, at any rate as far as the general good is\nconcerned. And the general welfare, gentlemen,\nmust always be our highest endeavour; I have no\ndoubt that\u2014if the truth were known\u2014it is the ambi-\ntion of every one here present. I drink the health of\nall those who have this day honoured my house, and\nI hope that I may often\u2014in the future\u2014enjoy the\nsame privilege.\u201d\n\nCaptain Gyllenborst, who was slightly intoxicated,\nreplied in a lengthy, facetious speech which, delivered\nat a different house, before people in a different mood,\nwould have been called scandalous.\n\nHe abused the commercial spirit which was spread-\ning, and declared that he had plenty of self-respect,\nalthough he was by no means financially independent ;\nhe had been obliged, this very morning, to settle some\nbusiness of a most disagreeable nature\u2014but in spite\nof this he had suflicient strength of character to be\npresent at the banquet ; and as far as his social posi-\ntion was concerned, it was second to none\u2014he felt\nsure that this was everybody\u2019s opinion, for otherwise\nhe would not be sitting at this table, the guest of so\ncharming a host.\n\nWhen he had concluded, the party drew a breath\nof relief. \u2018It was as if a thundercloud had passed\nover our heads,\u2019\u2019 remarked the beauty, and Arvid\nFalk heartily agreed.\n\nThere was so much humbug, so much deceit in the\natmosphere that Arvid longed to take his leave.\nThese people, who appeared so honest and respect-\nable, seemed to be held by an invisible chain at\nwhich they tore every now and then with suppressed\nfury. Captain Gyllenborsttreated his host with open,\n", "though facetious contempt. Hesmoked a cigar in the\ndrawing-room, generally behaved like a _boor, and\ntook no notice whatever of the ladies. He spat in\nthe fire-place, mercilessly criticized the eter to on\nthe walls, and loudly expressed his contempt for the\nmahogany furniture. The other gentlemen were\nindifferent ; they gave Falk the impression that they\nwere on duty.\n\nIrritated and upset, he left the party unnoticed.\n\nIn the street below stood Olle waiting for him.\n\n\u201cJ really didn\u2019t think you would come,\u201d said Olle.\n** It\u2019s so beautifully light up there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a reason! I wish you\u2019d been there!\u201d\n\n** How is Lundell getting on in smart society ? \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t envy him. He won\u2019t have an easy time\nif he\u2019s going to make his way as a portrait-painter.\nBut let\u2019s talk of something else. I have been longing\nfor this evening, so as to study the working man at\nclose quarters. It will be like a breath of fresh air\nafter these deadly fumes ; I feel as if I were allowed\nto take a stroll in the wood, after having long been\nlaid up in a hospital. I wonder whether I shall be\ndisillusioned.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cThe working man is suspicious; you will have\nto be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cTs he generous? Free from pettiness ? Or has\nooh \u2014 which has lain on him for so long spoiled\n\nim 3\u201d?\n\n** You'll be able to see for yourself. Most things\nin this world differ from our expectations.\u201d\n\n** That\u2019s true, unfortunately.\u201d\n\nHalf an hour later they had arrived in the great\nhall of the working men\u2019s union \u201cStar of the\nNorth.\u201d\u2019 The place was already crowded. Arvid\u2019s\nblack dresscoat did not create a good impression ;\nhe caught many an unfriendly glance from angry\neyes.\n\nOlle introduced Arvid to a tall, gaunt man with a\nface full of passion, who seemed to be troubled with\nan incessant cough,\n\nB\n", "** Joiner Eriksson ! \u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018\u201c*'That\u2019s me,\u201d\u2019 said the latter, \u201c\u2018 and is this one of\nthose gentlemen who want to put up for election ?\nHe doesn\u2019t look big enough for that.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c No, no,\u201d said Olle, \u201c he\u2019s here for the newspaper.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c Which newspaper ? There are so many different\nsorts. Perhaps he\u2019s come to make fun of us ?\u201d\u2019\n\n** No, no, nothing of the sort,\u201d said Olle. \u2018\u2018 He\u2019s a\nfriend, and he'll do all he ean for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cT see! That alters the matter. But I don\u2019t\ntrust those gentlemen; one of them lived with us,\nthat is to say, we lived in the same house, in the\nWhite Mountains; he was the landlord\u2019s agent\u2014\nStruve was the rascal\u2019s name.\u201d\n\nThere was a rap with the hammer. The chair was\ntaken by an elderly man, Wheelwright L\u00e9fgren,\nalderman and holder of the medal Litteris et artibus.\nHe had held many offices and acquired a great deal\nof dramatic routine. A certain venerability, capable\nof quelling storms and silencing noisy meetings,\ncharacterized him. His broad face, ornamented by\nside-whiskers and a pair of spectacles, was framed by\na judge\u2019s wig.\n\nThe secretary who sat at his side was one of the\nsupernumeraries of the great Board of Functionaries ;\nhe wore eyeglasses and expressed with a peasant\u2019s\ngrin his dissatisfaction with everything that was\nsaid.\n\nThe front bench was filled by the most aristocratic\nmembers of the Union : officers, Government officials,\nwholesale merchants ; they supported all loyal reso-\nlutions, and with their superior parliamentary skill\nvoted against every attempt at reform.\n\nThe secretary read the minutes, which the front\nbench approved.\n\nNext the first item of the agenda was read :\n\n\u201cThe Preparatory Committee would suggest that\nthe working men\u2019s union \u2018 Star of the North \u2019 should\nexpress the dissatisfaction which every right-thinking\ncitizen must feel in regard to the unlawful movements\n", "which under the name of strikes are spreading nearly\nall over Europe.\u201d\n\n*\u2018 Ts this the pleasure of the Union ? \u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes ! \u2019\u2019 shouted the front bench.\n\n\u201cMr. President ! \u2019\u2019 called out the joiner from the\nWhite Mountains.\n\n\u2018\u201c* Who is making so much noise at the back ?\u201d\u2019\nasked the chairman, looking over his spectacles with\na face which suggested that he would presently have\nrecourse to the cane.\n\n\u2018\u201c\u2018 Nobody is making any noise; I am asking for\npermission to speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is 1?\u201d\n\n** Master-joiner Eriksson.\u201d\n\n\u201c* Are you a master ? Since when ? \u201d\n\n**T am a journeyman out of my time; I have\nnever had the means to be made free of the city, but\nI am every bit as skilful as any other master and I\nwork on my own account.\u201d\n\n**T request the journeyman-joiner Eriksson to sit\ndown and stop interfering.

It is much to be\nregretted that at a mecting of this Union, which has\na reputation for dignified conduct (last displayed at\nthe Royal wedding), people without the smallest trace\nof Parliamentary tact should be permitted to com-\npromise a respectable society by a shameless and\nreckless contempt of all scemliness. Believe me,\ngentlemen, such a thing could never have happened\nin a country where from early youth military disci-\npline . . .\u201d\n\n** Conscription,\u201d said Eriksson to Olle.\n\n\u201c . . had been the rule; where the habit of con-\ntrolling oneself and others had been acquired! I\nbelieve I am expressing the general feeling of the\nmeeting when I say that I hope that such a distressing\nscene may never again occur amongst us. I say us\u2014\nfor I, too, am a working man\u2014we all are in the sight\nof the Eternal\u2014and I say it as a member of this Union.\nThe day would be a day of mourning when I should\nfind myself compelled to withdraw the words which I\nrecently uttered at another meeting (it was at the\nmeeting of the National League of Promoters of\nConscription), the words: \u2018 I have a high opinion of\nthe Swedish working man.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2018* Hear, hear! Hear, hear!\u201d\n\n*\u201c Does the mecting accept the suggestion of the\nPreparatory Committee ? \u201d\n\n* Yes! Yes!\u201d ?\n\n\u201cSecond item: At the instigation of several\nmembers of the Union, the Preparatory Committee\nsubmit to the meeting the proposal to collect a sum,\nnot exceeding three thousand crowns, as a testimonial\nto the Duke of Dalsland at his forthcoming confirma-\ntion. The gift is to be an expression of the gratitude\nof the working man to the Royal Family and, more\nespecially, of his disapproval of those working men\u2019s\n", "ON SWEDEN 261\ndisturbances which under the name of \u2018Commune \u2019\ndevastated the French capital.\u201d\n\n** Mr. Chairman ! \u201d\n\n** Doctor Haberfeld ! \u201d\n\n** No, it\u2019s I, Eriksson; I ask permission to say a\nfew words.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!

I call it corrup-\ntion and treachery. Nothing but meanness and\nselfishness. There isn\u2019t a man amongst them who has\nthe cause really at heart. And therefore the things\nwhich must happen will happen.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* What things ? \u201d\n\n\u201cWe'll see!\u201d said the joiner, taking Olle\u2019s hand.\n** Are you ready ?

But if he will promise not to exceed half an\nhour, we will hear what he has got to say. What do\nyou say, gentlemen ? \u201d\n\n\u2018Hear! Hear!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c If you please, Mr. Montanus.\u201d\u2019\n\nOlle shook himself like a dog about to jump, and\n", "262 THE RED ROOM\nthreaded his way through the assembly, who examined\nhim with curious eyes.\n\nThe chairman began a brief conversation with the\nfront bench, and the seeretary yawned before taking\nup a newspaper, to show the meeting that he, for one,\nwas not going to listen.\n\nOlle stepped on the platform, lowered his heavy\neyelids and moved his jaws, pretending to be speak-\ning ; when the room had grown really silent, so silent\nthat everybody could hear what the chairman said\nto the captain, he began :\n\n\u201c\u201cOn Sweden. Some points of view.\u201d\n\nAnd after a pause :\n\n\u2018** Gentlemen ! It might be more than an unfounded\nsupposition to say that the most productive idea and\nthe most vigorous striving of our times is the sup-\npression of short-sighted patriotism, which divides\nnations and pits them against one another as foes ;\nwe have seen the means used to gain this object,\nnamely, international exhibitions and their results :\nhonorary diplomas.\u201d\n\nThe audience looked puzzled. \u2018*\u2018 What\u2019s he driving\nat?\u201d said Eriksson. \u201c\u2018 It\u2019s rather unexpected, but\nit sounds all right.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018** Now, as in the past, Sweden marches at the head\nof civilization ; she has more than any other nation\nspread the cosmopolitan ideal, and if one may rely\non statistics, she has attained a great deal. Execep-\ntionally favourable cireumstances have contributed\nto this result. I will examine them shortly, and then\npass on to lighter subjects such as the form of govern-\nment, the ground-tax, and so on.\u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s going to be rather long,\u2019\u201d\u2019 said Eriksson,\nnudging Arvid, \u2018\u2018 but he\u2019s an amusing chap.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c Sweden, as everybody knows, was originally a\nGerman colony, and the Swedish language, which has\nbeen preserved fairly pure to our days, is neither more\nnor less than Low-German and its twelve dialects.\nThis circumstance\u2014I mean the difficulty of commu-\nnicating with one another, experienced by the pro-\n", "vinces\u2014has been a powerful factor in counteracting\nthe development of that unhealthy national feeling.\nOther fortunate facts have opposed a one-sided\nGerman influence which had reached its pinnacle\nwhen Sweden became a German province under\nAlbrecht of Mecklenburg. The foremost of these\nfacts is the conquest of the Danish provinces : Scania,\nHalland, Bleking, Bohuslin, and Dalsland ; Sweden\u2019s\nrichest provinces are inhabited by Danes who still\nspeak the language of their country and refuse to\nacknowledge the Swedish rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat in the name of fortune is he getting at ?\nIs he mad ?\u201d\u201d\n\n\u2018The inhabitants of Scania, for instance, to this\nday look upon Copenhagen as their capital, and\nconstitute the opposition in Parliament. The same\nthing applies to the Danish G\u00e9teborg, which does not\nacknowledge Stockholm as the capital of the realm.\nAn English settlement has sprung up there and\nEnglish influence is predominant. These people, the\nEnglish people, fish in the waters near the coast, and\nduring the winter very nearly all the wholesale trade\nis in their hands ; they return to their own country\nin the summer and enjoy their winter profits in their\nvillas in the Seotch Highlands. Very excellent\npeople, though! They have even their own news-\npaper, in which they commend their own actions,\nwithout, it must be admitted, blaming those of\nothers.\n\n\u201cImmigration is another factor of the utmost\nimportance. We have the Fins in the Finnish forests, 4\nbut we also have them in the capital, where they took\nrefuge when the political situation drove them out of\ntheir own country. In all our more important iron-\nworks you will find a fair number of Walloons ; they\ncame over in the seventeenth century and to this day\nspeak their broken French. You all know that we\nowe the new Swedish constitution to a Walloon.\nCapable people, these Walloons, and very honest ! \u201d\n\n** What in the name of heaven does it all mean ?\u201d\n", "\u201cIn the reign of King Gustavus Adolphus a whole\ncargo of Scotch scum landed on our coast and took\nservice in the army; they eventually forced their\nway into the House of Knights. At the East coast\nthere are many families who cherish traditions of\ntheir immigration from Livland and other Slavonic\nprovinces, and so it is not surprising that we frequently\nmeet here pure Tartar types.\n\n\u201c\u201cT maintain that the Swedish nation is fast be-\ncoming denationalized. Open a book on heraldry\nand count the Swedish names! If they exceed 25\nper cent. you may cut off my nose, gentlemen ! Open\nthe directory at random! 1 counted the letter G, and\nof four hundred names two hundred were foreign.\n\n\u2018\u201cWhat is the cause of this? There are many\ncauses, but the principal ones are the foreign dynasties\nand the wars of conquest. If one thinks of all the\nscum that has sat on the Swedish throne at onetime\nor another, one cannot help marvelling that the\nnation is so loyal to the king. The constitutional law\nthat the kings of Sweden shall be foreigners is bound\nto be of the greatest assistance in the work of dena-\ntionalization; this has been proved to be a fact.\n\n\u201c\u201cT am convinced that the country will gain by its\nalliance with foreign nations; it cannot lose any-\nthing\u2014because it has nothing to lose. The country\nhas no nationality ; Tegn\u00e9r discovered that in 1811,\nand short-sightedly bemoaned the fact. But his\ndiscovery came too late, for the race had already been\nruined by the constant recruiting for the foolish wars\nof conquest. Of the one million men which inhabited\nthe country in the days of Gustavus Adolphus, seventy\nthousand enlisted and were killed in the wars. I do\nnot know for how many Charles X, Charles XI, and\nCharles XII were responsible ; but it is easy to picture\nthe offspring of those who remained behind, the men\nwhom the crown had rejected as unfit for service.\n\n\u201c\u201cT repeat my statement that Sweden has no\nnationality. Can anybody tell me of anything\nSwedish in Sweden except her firs, pine trees, and\n", "iron-mines ? And the latter will soon disappear from\nthe market. What is our folk-lore but bel transla-\ntions of French, English, and German ballads ? What\nare the national costumes, the disappearance of which\nwe so keenly regret, other than fragments and tatters\nof the aristocratic medizval costumes ? In the days\nof Gustavus I the dalesmen demanded that all those\nwho wore low-cut or many-coloured dresses should be\npunished. Probably the gay court-dress from Bur-\ngundy had not yet filtered down to the daleswomen.\nBut since then the fashion has changed many times.\n\n\u201cTell me of a Swedish poem, a work of art, a piece\nof music, so specifically Swedish that it differs from\nall other not-Swedish ones! Show me a Swedish\nbuilding! There isn\u2019t one, and if there were, it would\n=o aad he bad architecture or built in a foreign\nstyle.\n\n\u201cT don\u2019t think I\u2019m exaggerating when I maintain -\nthat the Swedish nation is a stupid, conceited, slavish, \u00a9\nenvious, and uncouth nation. And for this reason it\nis approaching its end, and approaching it with giant\nstrides.\u201d\n\nA tumult arose in the hall, but shouts of Charles XII\ncould be heard above the turmoil. ;\n\n** Gentlemen, Charles XII is dead; let him sleep\nuntil his next jubilee. To no one are we more\nindebted for our denationalisation than to him, and\ntherefore, gentlemen, I call for three cheers for\nCharles XII! Gentlemen, long live Charles XII!\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT call the meeting to order !\u201d shouted the chair-\nman.\n\n\u201c\u201cIs it possible to imagine that a nation can be\nguilty of a greater piece of folly than to go to foreign\nnations in order to fan to write poetry ?\n\n*\u201c What unsurpassable oxen they must have been\nto walk for sixteen hundred years behind the plough\nand never conceive the idea of inventing a song !\n\n\u201c\u201cThen a jolly fellow of the court of Charles XII\ncame along and destroyed the whole work of dena-\ntionalization. The literary language, which up to\n", "now had been German, was henceforth to be Swedish :\nDown with the dog Stjernhjelm !\n\n\u201cWhat was his name ? Edward Stjernstr\u00e9m ! \u201d\n\nThe chairman\u2019s hammer came down on the table\nwith a bang. The disturbance grew. \u2018* Stop him!\nDown with the traitor! He\u2019s laughing at us!\u201d\n\n\u201che Swedish nation can screain and brawl, I am\naware of that! They can do nothing else! And as\nyou will not allow me to continue my lecture and\ndiscuss the Government and the royal copyholds, I\nwill conclude by saying that the servile louts whom\nI have heard to-night are ripe for the autocracy which\nthey are sure to get. Believe my words: You will\nhave an absolute monarchy before very long !\u201d\n\nA push from the back jerked the words of the\nspeaker out of his throat. He clung to the table:\n\n\u201cAnd an ungrateful race who will not listen to the\ntruths; o .\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201c Kick him out! Tear him to pieces ! \u201d\n\nOlle was dragged from the platform; but to the\nlast moment, while knocks and blows rained down on\nhim, he yelled like a madman: \u2018 Long live Charles\nXII! Down with George Sternhjelm ! \u201d\n\nAt last Olle and Arvid were standing in the street.\n\n\u2018** Whatever were you thinking of ?\u201d asked Falk.\n** You must have taken leave of your senses ! \u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cT believe [had ! Ihad learnt my speech by heart\nfor the last six weeks ; I knew to a word what I was\ngoing to say ; but when I stood on the platform and\nsaw all those eyes gazing at me, it all went to pieces ;\nmy artificial arguments broke down like a scaffolding ;\nthe floor underneath my feet gave way, and my\nthoughts became confusion. Was it very crazy ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it was bad, and the papers will pull you to\npieces.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cThat\u2019s a pity, ladmit. I thought I was making\nitallsoclear. But it was fun to give it them for once.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou only injured your cause; they\u2019ll never let\nyou speak again.\u201d\n\nOllie sighed.\n", "\u201c\u201cWhy in the name of fortune couldn\u2019t you leave\nCharles XII alone ? That was your worst mistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t ask me! I don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\n** Do you still love the working man ?\u201d asked Falk.\n\n**T pity him for allowing himself to be humbugged\nby adventurers, and I shall never abandon his cause,\nfor his cause is the burning question of the near\nfuture, and all your politics aren\u2019t worth a penny in\ncomparison.\u201d\n\nThe two friends were making their way back to old\nStockholm, and finally entered a caf\u00e9.\n\nIt was between nine and ten and the room was\nalmost empty. A single customer was sitting near\nthe counter. He was reading from a book to a girl\nwho sat beside him doing needlework. It was a\npretty, domestic scene, but it seemed to make a strong\nimpression on Falk, who started violently and changed\ncolour.\n\n\u2018*Sell\u00e9n! You here ? Good evening, Beda!\u201d he\nsaid, with artificial cordiality which sat strangely on\nhim, shaking hands with the girl.\n\n\u201cHallo! Falk, old chap!\u201d said Sell\u00e9n. \u2018\u2018 So you\nare in the habit of coming here too? I might have\nguessed it, you are hardly ever at the Red Room\nnow.\u201d\n\nArvid and Beda exchanged glances. The young\ngirl looked too distinguished for her position ; she had\na delicate, intelligent face, which betrayed a secrct\nsorrow ; and a slender figure. Her movements were\nfull of self-confidence and modesty ; her eyes were set\nin her face at a slightly upward angle; they seemed\nto be peering skyward as if they were anticipating evil\nto drop down from the clouds ; with this exception\nthey looked as if they were ready to play all the\ngames which the whim of the moment might dictate.\n\n** How grave you are,\u201d she said to Arvid, and her\ngaze dropped to her sewing.\n\n\u201c\u201cTve been to a grave meeting,\u201d said Arvid, blush-\ning like a girl. \u2018*\u2018 What were you reading ?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cT was reading the Dedication from Faust,\u201d said\n", "Sell\u00e9n, stretching out his hand and playing with Beda\u2019s\nneedlework.\n\nA cloud darkened Arvid\u2019s face. The conversation\nbecame foreed and restrained. Olle sat plunged in\nmeditations, the subject of which must have been\nsuicide.\n\nArvid asked for a paper and was given the In-\ncorruptible. He remembered that he had forgotten to\nlook for the review of his poems. He hastily opened\nthe paper and on page three he found what he sought.\n\nHis eyes met neither compliments nor abuse ;_ the\narticle was dictated by genuine and deep interest.\nThe reviewer found Arvid\u2019s poetry neither better nor\nworse than the average, but just as selfish and mean-\ningless; he said that it treated only of the poet\u2019s\nprivate affairs, of illicit relations, real or fictitious ;\nthat it coquetted with little sins, but did not mourn\nover great ones; that it was no better than the\nEnglish fashion-paper poetry, and he suggested that\nthe author\u2019s portrait should have preceded the title-\npage ; then the poems would have been illustrated.\n\nThese simple truths made a great impression on\nArvid; he had only read the advertisement in the\nGrey Bonnet, written by Struve, and the review in the\nRed Cap, coloured by personal friendship. He rose\nwith a brief good-night.\n\n\u2018\u201c* Are you going already ?\u201d\u2019 asked Beda.\n\n\u201cYes; are we going to meet to-morrow ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, as usual. Good-night.\u201d\u2019\n\nSell\u00e9n and Olle followed him.\n\n\u2018** She\u2019s a rare child,\u201d said Sell\u00e9n, after they had\nproceeded a little way in silence.\n\n\u2018**T should thank you to be a little more restrained\nin your criticism.\u201d\n\n\u201cTsee. You're in love with her!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I hope you don\u2019t mind.\u201d\n\n** Not in the least. I shan\u2019t get into your way !\u201d\u2019\n\n** And I beg you not to believe any evil of her. . . .\u201d\n\n\u2018Of course I won\u2019t ! She\u2019s been on the stage... .\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* How do you know ? She never told me that!\u201d\n", "** No, but she told me; one can never trust these\nlittle devils too far.\u201d\n\n\u2018*Oh well! there\u2019s no harm in that! I shall take\nher away from her surroundings as soon as I possibly\nean. Our relations are limited to meeting in the\nHaga Park at eight in the morning and drinking the\nwater from the well.\u201d\n\n\u2018** How sweet and simple! Do you never take her\nout to supper ?\u201d\n\n**T never thought of making such an ya\nsuggestion ; she would refuse it with scorn. You are\nlaughing! Laugh if you like! I still have faith ina\nwoman who loves whatever class she may belong to,\nand whatever her past may have been. She told me\nthat her life had not been above reproach, but I have\npromised never to ask her about her past.\u201d\n\n\u2018*Ts it serious then ?\u201d\n\n** Yes, it is serious.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201cThat\u2019s another thing; Good-night, Falk! Are\nyou coming with me, Olle ?\u201d\n\n\u201c Good night.\u201d\n\n\u201cPoor Falk!\u201d said Sell\u00e9n to Olle. \u2018\u2018 Now it\u2019s his\nturn to go through the mill. But there\u2019s no help for\nit ; it\u2019s like changing one\u2019s teeth ; a man is not grown\nup until he has had his experience.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the girl?\u201d asked Olle, merely in\norder to show a polite interest, for his thoughts were\nelsewhere.\n\n\u201c\u201cShe\u2019s all right in her way, but Falk takes the\nmatter seriously ; she does too, apparently, as long\nas she sees any prospect of winning him; but unless\nFalk\u2019s quick about it, she will grow tired of waiting,\nand who knows whether she won\u2019t amuse herself\nmeanwhile with somebody else? No, you don\u2019t\nunderstand these things ; a man shouldn\u2019t hesitate in\na love-affair, but grab with both hands; otherwise\nsomebody else will step in and spoil the game. Have\nyou ever been in love, Olle ?\u201d\n\n**T had an affair with one of our servants at home ;\nthere were consequences, and my father turned me\n", "out of the house. Since then I haven\u2019t looked at a\nwoman.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cThat was nothing very complicated. But to be\nbetrayed, as it is called, that\u2019s what hurts, I can tell\nyou! One must have nerves like the strings of a\nviolin to play that game. We shall see what sort\nof a fight Falk will make ; with some men it goes very\ndeep, and that\u2019s a pity.\n\n\u00abThe dooris open, come in Olle! I hope the beds\nare properly made, so that you will lie softly ; but you\nmust excuse my old bed-maker, she cannot shake up\nthe feather-beds ; her fingers are weak, don\u2019t you see,\nand the pillow, I\u2019m afraid, may be hard and lumpy.\u201d\n\nThey had climbed the stairs and were entering the\nstudio.\n\n\u201cTt smells damp, as if the servant had aired the\nroom or scrubbed it.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* You are laughing at yourself! There can be no\nmore scrubbing, you have no longer a floor.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cHaven\u2019t I? Ah! That makes a difference!\nBut what has become of it ? Has it been used for\nfuel ? There\u2019s nothing for it then, but to lie down on\nour mother earth, or rubbish, or whatever it may be.\u201d\n\nThey lay down in their clothes on the floor-packing,\nhaving made a kind of bed for themselves of pieces of\ncanvas and old newspapers, and pushed cases filled\nwith sketches underneath their heads. Olle struck a\nmatch, produced a tallow candle from his trousers\npocket and put it on the floor beside him. A faint\ngleam flickered through the huge, bare studio,\npassionately resisting the volumes of darkness which\ntried to pour in through the colossal windows.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold to-night,\u201d said Olle, opening a greasy\nbook.\n\n\u201cCold! Oh no! There are only twenty degrees\nof frost outside, and thirty in here because we are so\nhigh up. What\u2019s the time, I wonder ?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c*T believe St. John\u2019s just struck one.\u201d\n\n\u201cSt. John\u2019s ? They have no clock! They are so\npoor that they had to pawn it.\u201d\n", "There was a long pause which was finally broken by\nSell\u00e9n.\n\n*\u201c What are you reading, Olle ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind !\u201d\n\n\u2018**Never mind ? Hadn\u2019t you better be more civil,\nseeing that you are my guest ?\u201d\n\n**An old cookery book which I borrowed from\nYgberg.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe deuce you did! Do let\u2019s read it; I\u2019ve only\nhad a cup of coffee and three glasses of water to-day.\u201d\n\n** What would you like ?\u201d\u2019 asked Olle, turning over\nthe leaves. \u2018*Would you like some fish? Do you\nknow what a mayonnaise is ?\u201d\n\n**Mayonnaise ? No! Read it! It sounds good!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, listen! No. 189. Mayonnaise: Take some\nbutter, flour, and a pinch of English mustard, and\nmake it into a smooth paste. Beat it up with good\nstock, and when boiling add the yolks of a few eggs ;\nbeat well and let it stand to cool.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, thank you; that\u2019s not filling enough. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, but that\u2019s not all. Then take a few spoonfuls\nof fine salad oil, vinegar, a spoonful of cream, some\nwhite pepper\u2014oh, yes, I see now, it\u2019s no good. Do\nyou want something more substantial ? \u201d\n\nie Try and find toad-in-the-hole. It\u2019s my favourite\ndish.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT can\u2019t go on reading.\u201d\n\noe Do ! \u201d?\n\n\u201c* No, leave me alone!\u201d\n\nThey were silent. The candle went out and it was\nquite dark.\n\n\u201c\u201cGood-night, Olle; wrap yourself well up, or\nyou'll be cold.\u201d\n\n** What with ?\u201d\n\n\u201cIT don\u2019t know. Aren\u2019t we having a jolly time ? \u201d\n\n\u2018**T wonder why one doesn\u2019t kill oneself when one\nis so cold.\u201d\n\n\u201c* Because it would be wrong. I find it quite in-\nteresting to live, if only to see what will come of it\ngall in the end.\u201d\n", "** Are your parents alive, Scll\u00e9n ?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cNo; I\u2019m illegitimate. Yours ?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cYes ; but it comes to the same thing.\u201d\n\n** You should be more grateful to Providence, Olle ;\none should always be grateful to Providence\u2014I don\u2019t\nquite know why. But I suppose one should.\u201d\n\nAgain there was silence. The next time it was\nOlle who broke it.\n\n\u201cAre you asleep ?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; I\u2019m thinking of the statue of Gustavus\nAdolphus ; would you believe me when I. . .\u201d\n\n\u201c* Aren\u2019t you cold ?\u201d\n\n\u201cCold? It\u2019s quite warm here.\u201d\n\n\u201c* My right foot is frozen.\u201d\n\n\u201c* Pull the paint box over you, and tuck the brushes\nround your sides, then you\u2019ll be warmer.\u201d\n\n\u2018** Do you think anybody in the world is as badly off\nas we are?\u201d\n\n\u201c* Badly off ? Do you call us badly off when we\nhave a roof over our heads ? Some of the professors\nat the Academy, men who wear three-cornered hats\nand swords now, were much worse off than we are.\nProfessor Lundstr\u00e9m slept during nearly the whole of\nApril in the theatre in the Hop garden. There was\nstyle in that ! He had the whole of the left stage-box,\nand he maintains that after one o\u2019clock there wasn\u2019t a\nsingle stall vacant ; there was always a good house in\nthe winter anda bad oneinthesummer. Good night,\nI\u2019m going to sleep now.\u201d\n\nSell\u00e9n snored. But Olle rose and paced the room,\nup and down, until the dawn broke in the east ; then\nday took pity on him and gave him the peace which\nnight had denied him.\n", "CHAPTER XXV\nCHECKMATE\nTue winter passed; slowly for the sufferers, more\nquickly for those who were less unhappy. Spring\ncame with its disappointed hopes of sun and verdure,\nand in its turn made room for the summer which was\nbut a short introduction to the autumn.\n\nOn a May morning Arvid Falk, now a member of\nthe permanent stafi of the Workman\u2019s Flag, was\nstrolling along the quay, watching the vessels loading\nand discharging their cargoes. He looked less well-\u2014\ngroomed than in days gone by; his black hair was\nlonger than fashion decreed, and he wore a beard 4 la\nHenri IV, which gave his thin face an almost savage\neee An ominous fire burned in his eyes,\na fire denoting the fanatic or the drunkard.\n\nHe seemed to be endeavouring to make a choice\namong the vessels, but was unable to come to a\ndecision. After hesitating for a considerable time,\nhe accosted one of the sailors, who was wheeling a\nbarrow full of goods on to a brig. He courteously\nraised his hat.\n\n\u201cCan you tell me the destination of this ship ?\u201d\nhe asked timidly, imagining that he was speaking\nin a bold voice. ,\n\n\u201cShip ? I see no ship ?\u201d\n\nThe bystanders laughed.\n\n** But if you want to know where this brig\u2019s bound\nfor, go and read that bill over there ! \u201d\n\nFalk was disconcerted, but he forced himself to\nsay, angrily :\n\n\u201c\u201cCan\u2019t you give a civil reply to a civil question ? \u201d\n\n273 s\n", "\u201cGo to hell, and don\u2019t stand there swearing at a\nfellow !\u2014\u2019tention ! \u201d\n\nThe conversation broke off, and Falk made up his\nmind. He retraced his footsteps, passed through a\nnarrow street, crossed a market-place, and turned\nthe first corner. Before the door of a dirty-looking\nhouse he stopped. Again he hesitated; he could\nnever overcome his besetting sin of indecision.\n\nA small, ragged boy with a squint came running\nalong, his hands full of proofs in long strips; as he\nwas going to pass Falk, the latter stopped him.\n\n\u201cIs the editor upstairs ? \u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s been here since seven,\u201d replied the\nboy, breathlessly.\n\n** Has he asked for me ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, more than once.\u201d\n\n\u201cTs he in a bad temper ?\u201d\n\n** He always is.\u201d\n\nThe boy shot upstairs like an arrow. Falk, fol-\nlowing on his heels, entered the editorial office. It\nwas a hole with two windows looking on a dark\nstreet ; before each of the windows stood a plain\ndeal table, covered with paper, pens, newspapers,\nscissors and a gum bottle.\n\nOne of the tables was occupied by his old friend\nYgberg, dressed in a ragged black coat, engaged in\nreading proofs. At the other table, which was\nFalk\u2019s, sat a man in shirt sleeves, his head covered\nby a black silk cap of the kind affected by the com-\nmunards. His face was covered by a red beard, and\nhis thick-set figure with its clumsy outlines betrayed\nthe man of the people.\n\nAs Falk entered, the communard\u2019s legs kicked the\ntable violently ; he turned up his shirt-sleeves, dis-\nplaying blue tattoo marks representing an anchor\nand an Anglo-Saxon R, seized a pair of scissors,\nsavagely stabbed the front page of a morning paper,\ncut out a paragraph, and said, rudely, with his back\nto Falk:\n\n\u201cWhere have you been ?\u201d\n", "**T\u2019ve been ill,\u2019 replied Falk, defiantly, as he\nthought, but humbly as Ygberg told him afterwards.\n\n\u201cTes a lie! You\u2019ve been drinking! I saw you\nat a caf\u00e9 last night... .\u201d\n\n\u201c* Surely I can go where I please.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can do what you like; but you\u2019ve got to\nbe here at the stroke of the clock, according to our\nagreement. It\u2019s a quarter past eight. I am well\naware that gentlemen who have been to college,\nwhere they imagine they learn a lot, have no idea\nof method and manners. Don\u2019t you call it ill-bred\nto be late at your work? Aren\u2019t you behaving like\na boor when you compel your employer to do your\nwork ? What? It\u2019s the world turned upside down !\nThe employ\u00e9 treats the master\u2014the employer, if you\nlike\u2014as if he were a dog, and capital is oppressed.\u201d\n\n** When did you come to these conclusions ? \u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cWhen ? Just now, sir! just now! And I trust\nthese conclusions are worth considering, in spite of\nthat. But I discovered something else ; you are an\nignoramus ; youcan\u2019t spell! Look at this! What\u2019s\nwritten here? Read it! \u2018We hope that all those\nwho will have to go through their drill next year. . . .\u2019\nIs it possible? \u2018Who... neat year... .\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s quite right,\u201d said Falk.\n\n\u201cRight ? How dare you say it\u2019s right? It\u2019s\ncustomary to say who in the next year, and con-\nsequently it should also be written in this form.\u201d\n\n*That\u2019s right, too; definitions of time govern\neither the accusative or. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c None of your learned palaver! Don\u2019t talk non-\nsense to me! Besides this you spell ex-ercise with\nan x only, although it should be spelt ea-sercise.\nDon\u2019t make excuses\u2014is it ex-ercise or ex-sercise ? \u201d\n\n\u201c* Of course people say. . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople say\u2014therefore ex-sercise is right; the\ncustomary pronunciation must be correct. Perhaps,\nall things considered, I\u2019m a fool? Perhaps I can\u2019t\nspelleorrectly ? But enough,now! Getto workand\nanother time pay a little more attention to the clock.\u201d\n", "He aes up from his chair with a yell, and boxed\nthe ears of the printer\u2019s boy.\n\n\u201cAre you sleeping in bright daylight, you young\nscamp ? I'll teach you to keep awake. You are\nnot yet too old for a thrashing.\u201d\n\nHe seized the victim by the braces, threw him on a\npile of unsold papers, and beat him with his belt.\n\n\u201c\u201cT wasn\u2019t asleep! I wasn\u2019t asleep! I was only\nclosing my eyes a little,\u201d howled the boy.\n\n\u201cWhat, you dare to deny it? You\u2019ve learned to\nlie, but I will teach you to speak the truth! Were\nyou \u2014 or were you not asleep? Tell the truth\nor you'll be sorry for it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t asleep,\u201d\u2019 whimpered the boy, too young\nand inexperienced to get over his difficulty by telling\na lie.\n\n** Tsee, you mean to stand by your lie, you hardened\nlittle devil! You insolent liar!\u201d\n\nHe was going to continue the thrashing when Falk\nrose, approached the editor, and said firmly :\n\n\u2018**Don\u2019t touch him! I saw that he was not\nasleep ! \u201d\n\n** By jove! Listen to him! Who the dickens are\nyou? Don\u2019t touch him! Who said those words ?\nI must have heard a gnat buzzing. Or perhaps my\nears deceived me. I hope so! I do hope so! Mr.\nYgberg! You are a decent fellow. You haven't\nbeen to college. Did you happen to see whether this\nboy, whom I\u2019m holding by the braces like a fish, was\nasleep or not ?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cIf he wasn\u2019t asleep,\u201d replied Ygberg, phleg-\nmatically and obligingly, \u201c\u2018 he was just on the point\nof dropping off.\u201d\n\n\u201c* Well answered! Would you mind holding him,\nMr. Ygberg, while I give him a lesson with my cane\nin telling the truth ?\u201d\n\n*\u201cYou\u2019ve no right to beat him,\u201d said Falk. \u201cIf\nyou dare to touch him, I shall open the window and\ncall for the police.\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c\u201cJ am master in my own house and I always\n", "thrash my apprentices. He is an apprentice and\nwill be employed in the editorial office later on.\nThat\u2019s what\u2019s going to be done, although there are\npeople who imagine that a paper can only be poe\nedited by a man who has been to college. Speak up,\nGustav, are you learning newspaper work ? Answer,\nbut tell the truth, or...\u201d\n\nBefore the boy had time to reply, the door was\nopened and a head looked in\u2014a very striking head,\nand certainly not one that might have been expected\nin such a place; but it was a well-known head; it\nhad been painted five times.\n\nAt the sight of it the editor strapped his belt\nround him, hastily put on his coat, bowed and\nsmiled.\n\nThe visitor asked whether the editor was dis-\nengaged ? He received a satisfactory reply, and the\nlast remnant of the working man disappeared when\na quick movement swept the communard\u2019s cap off\nthe editor\u2019s head.\n\nBoth men went into an inner office and the door\nclosed behind them.\n\n**T wonder what ghe Count\u2019s after ?\u201d\u2019 said Ygberg,\nwith the air of a Schoolboy, when the master had left\nthe class-room.\n\n** T don\u2019t wonder in the least,\u201d said Falk ; \u2018\u2018 I think\nI know the kind of rascal he is, and the kind of rascal\nthe editor is. But I am surprised to find that you\nhave changed from a mere blockhead into an infamous\nwretch, and that you lend yourself to these disgrace-\nful acts.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t lose your temper, my dear fellow! You\nwere not at the House last night ? \u201d\n\n*\u201c\u201cNo! In my opinion Parliament is a farce,\nexcept in so far as private interests are concerned.\nWhat about the \u2018Triton\u2019? \u201d\n\n\u201cThe question was put to the vote, and it was\nresolved that the Government, in view of the great-\nness, the patriotism, which characterized the enter-\nprise, should take over the debentures while the\n", "society went into liquidation, that is to say, settled\nthe current affairs.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c Which means that Government will prop up the\nhouse while the foundation crumbles away, so as to\ngive the directors time to get out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would rather that all those small . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cTI know what you are going to say, all those\nsmall capitalists. Yes, I would rather see them\nworking with their small capital than idling away\ntheir time and lending it out at interest ; but, above\nall things, I should like to see those sharpers in prison ;\nit would help to put a stop to these swindles. But\nthey call it political economy! It\u2019s vile! There\u2019s\nsomething else I want to say: You covet my post.\nYou shall have it! I hate the idea of your sitting\nin your corner with a heart filled with bitterness,\nbecause you have to sweep up after me in reading\nproofs. There are already too many of my unprinted\narticles lying on the desk of this contemptible apostle\nof liberty to tempt me to go on telling cock-and-bull\nstories. The Red Cap was too Conservative to\nplease me, but the People\u2019s Flag is too dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201c*T am glad to sce you relinquishing your chimeras\nand listening to common sense. Go to the Grey\nBonnet, you'll have a chance there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have lost the illusion that the cause of the\noppressed lies in good hands, and I think it would be\na splendid mission to enlighten the people on the\nvalue of public opinion\u2014especially printed public\nopinion\u2014and its origin; but I shall never abandon\nthe cause.\u201d\n\nThe door to the inner room opened again, and the\neditor came out. He stood still in the middle of the\noffice and said, in an unnaturally conciliatory voice,\nalmost politely :\n\n**T want you to look after the office for \u2018a day,\nMr. Falk. I have to go away on important\nbusiness. Mr. Ygberg will assist you so far as the\ndaily business is concerned. His Lordship will be\nusing my room for a few minutes, I hope, gentle-\n", "men, you will see that he has everything he\nwants.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, please don\u2019t trouble,\u201d came the Count\u2019s\nvoice from inside the room, where he was sitting\nbent over a manuscript.\n\nThe editor went and, strange to say, two minutes\nlater the Count went also; he had waited just long\nenough to avoid being seen in the company of the\neditor of the Workman\u2019s Flag.\n\n** Are you sure that he\u2019s gone ?\u201d\u2019 asked Ygberg.\n\n\u201c\u2018T hope so,\u201d said Falk.\n\n\u201c\u201cThen I'll go and have a look at the market.\nBy-the-by, have you seen Beda since ?\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018* Since when ?\u201d\n\n\u2018* Since she left the caf\u00e9 and went to live in a room\nby herself.\u201d\n\n\u201c* How do you know she did ?\u201d\n\n\u2018\u201c* Do control your temper, Falk. You'll never get\non in the world unless you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re right. I must take matters more\ncalmly, or else I'll go out of my mind! But that girl,\nwhom I loved so dearly! How shamefully she has\ntreated me! To give to that clumsy boor all she\ndenied to me! And then to have the face to tell me\nthat it proved the purity of her love for me ! \u201d\n\n\u201cMost excellent dialectics! And she is quite\nright too, for her first proposition is correct. She\ndoes love you, doesn\u2019t she ?\u201d\n\n*\u201c* She\u2019s running after me, anyhow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT hate her with all my soul, but I am afraid to\nmeet her.\u201d\n\n** Which proves that you are still in love with her.\u201d\n\n** Let\u2019s change the subject ! \u201d\n\n\u201cYou really must control yourself, Falk! Take\nan example from me! But now I'll go and sun\nmyself; one should enjoy life as much as possible\nin this dreary world. Gustav, you can go and play\n\nbuttons for an hour, if you like.\u201d\n\nFalk was left alone. The sun threw his rays over\n", "the steep roof opposite and warmed the room; he\nopened the window and put out his head for a breath\nof fresh air, but he only breathed the pungent odours\nof the gutter. His glance swept the street on the\nright and far away in the distance he saw a part\nof a steamer, a few waves of the Lake of Malar\nglittering in the sunlight, and a hollow in the rocks\non the other side, which were just beginning to show\na little green here and there. He thought of the\npeople whom that steamer would take into the\ncountry, who would bathe in those waves and feast\ntheir eyes on the young green. But at this moment\nthe whitesmith below him began to hammer a sheet\nof iron, so that house and window panes trembled ;\ntwo or three labourers went by with a rattling, evil-\nsmelling cart, and an odour of brandy, beer, sawdust,\nand pine-branches poured out of the inn opposite.\nHe shut the window and sat down at his table.\n\nBefore him lay a heap of about a hundred provincial\npapers, from which it was his task to make cuttings.\nHe took off his cuffs and began to look through them.\nThey smelt of oil and soot and blackened his hands\n\u2014that was their principal feature. Nothing he con-\nsidered worthy of reprinting was of any use, for he had\nto consider the programme of his paper. A report\nto the effect that the workmen of a certain factory\nhad given the foreman a silver snuff-box had to be\ncut out; but the notice of a manufacturer having\ngiven five hundred crowns to his working-men\u2019s\nfunds had to be ignored. A paragraph reporting that\nthe Duke of Halland had handselled a _pile-driver,\nand Director Holzheim celebrated the event in verses,\nhad to be cut out and reproduced in full \u2018\u201c* because\nthe people liked to read this kind of thing\u201d; if he\ncould add a little biting sarcasm, all the better, for\nthen \u2018\u2018 they were sure to hear about it.\u201d\n\nRoughly speaking, the rule was to cut out every-\nthing said in favour of journalists and working men -\nand everything depreciating clergymen, officers,\nwholesale merchants (not retail), the professions, and\n", "famous writers. Moreover, at least once a week, it\nwas his business to attack the management of the\nRoyal Theatre, and severely criticize the frivolous\nmusical comedies produced in the Little Theatre, in\nthe name of morality and public decency\u2014he had\nnoticed that the working men did not patronize\nthese theatres. Once a month the town councillors\nhad to be accused of extravagance. As often as\nopportunity arose the form of government, not\nGovernment itself, had to be assailed. The editor\nseverely censored al] attacks on certain members of\nParliament and ministers. Which? That was a\nmystery unknown to even the editor; it depended\non a combination of circumstances which only the\nsecret proprietor of the paper could deal with.\n\nFalk worked with his scissors until one of his\nhands was black. He had frequent recourse to the\ngum-bottle, but the gum smelt sour and the hcat in\nthe room was stifling. The poor aloe, capable of\nenduring thirst like a camel, and patiently receiving\ncountless stabs from an irritated steel-nib, increased\nthe terrible resemblance to a desert. It had been\nstabbed until it was covered with black wounds ;\nits leaves shot, like a bundle of donkeys\u2019 ears out of\nthe parched mould. Falk probably had a vague\nconsciousness of something of this sort, as he sat,\n\nlunged in thought, for before he could realize what\nbe was doing, he had docked off all the ear lobes.\nWhen he perceived what he had done, he painted\nthe wounds with gum and watched it drying in the\nsun.\n\nHe vaguely wondered for a few moments how he\nwas to get dinner, for he had strayed on to that\npath which leads to destruction, so-called poor cir-\ncumstances. Finally he lit a pipe and watched the\nsoothing smoke rising and bathing, for a few seconds\nin the sunshine. It made him feel more tolerant of\npoor Sweden, as she expressed herself in these daily,\nweekly, and monthly reports, called the Press.\n\nHe put the scissors aside and threw the papers into a\n", "corner ; he shared the contents of the earthen water-\nbottle with the aloe ; the miserable object looked like\na creature whose wings had been clipped; a spirit\nstanding in a bog on its head, digging for something ;\nfor pearls, for instance, or at any rate, for empty\nshells.\n\nThen despair, like a tanner, seized him again with a\nlong hook, and pushed him down into the vat, where\nhe was to be prepared for the knife, which should\nscrape his skin off and make him like everybody else.\nAnd he felt no remorse, no regret at a wasted life, but\nonly despair at having to die in his youth, die the\nspiritual death, before he had had an opportunity of\nbeing of use in the world ; despair that he was being\ncast into the fire as a useless reed.\n\nThe clock on the German church struck eleven, and\nthe chimes began to play \u2018\u201c Oh blessed land\u201d and\n\u2018\u201c* My life a wave\u201d; as if seized by the same idea, an\nItalian barrel-organ, with a flute accompaniment,\nbegan to play \u2018\u201c\u2018 The Blue Danube.\u201d\u2019 So much music\nput new life into the tinsmith below, who began\nhammering his iron-sheet with redoubled energy.\n\nThe din and uproar prevented Falk from becoming\naware of the opening of the door and the entrance of\ntwo men. One of them had a tall, lean figure, an\naquiline nose and long hair ; the other one was short,\nblond, and thick set; his perspiring face much\nresembled the quadruped which the Hebrews consider\nmore unclean than any other. Their outward appear-\nance betrayed an occupation requiring neither much\nmental nor great physical strength ; it had a quality\n\nof vagueness, pointing to irregularity of work and\nhabits.\n\n\u2018\u201c* Hsh ! \u201d whispered the tali man, \u201c are you alone ? \u201d\n\nFalk was partly pleased, partly annoyed at the sight\nof his visitors.\n\n** Quite alone ; the Red One\u2019s left town.\u201d\n\n\u2018Has he? Come along then and have some\ndinner.\u201d\n\nFalk had no objection ; he locked the office and\n", "went with his visitors to the nearest public-house,\nwhere the three of them sat down in the darkest\ncorner.\n\n\u201c\u2018 Here, have some brandy,\u201d said the thick-set man,\nwhose.glazed eyes sparkled at the sight of the brandy\nbottle.\n\nBut Falk who had only joined his friends because\nhe was yearning for sympathy and comfort, paid no\nattention to the proffered delights.\n\n\u2018*T haven\u2019t been as miserable as this for a long\ntime,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2018** Have some bread and butter and a herring,\u201d\u2019 said\nthe tall man. \u2018\u2018 We\u2019ll have some caraway cheese.\nHere! Waiter!\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t you advise me?\u201d Falk began again. \u201cI\ncan\u2019t stand the Red One any longer, andI must... .\u201d\n\n\u201cHere ! Waiter! Bring some black bread! Drink,\nFalk, and don\u2019t talk nonsense.\u201d :\n\nFalk was thrown out of the saddle; he made no\nsecond attempt to find sympathy with his mental\ndifficulties, but tried another, not unusual way.\n\n\u201cYour advice is the brandy bottle?\u201d he said.\n\u201c\u201c Very well, with all my soul, then ! \u201d\n\nThe alcohol flowed through his veins like poison, for\nhe was not accustomed to take strong drink in the\nmorning ; the smell of cooking, the buzzing of the\nflies, the odour of the faded flowers, which stood by\nthe side of the dirty table-centre, induced in him\na strange feeling of well-being. And his low com-\npanions with their neglected linen, their greasy coats,\nand their unwashed gaol-bird faces harmonized so well\nwith his own degraded position, that he felt a wild joy\nsurging in his heart.\n\n** We were in the Deer Park last night and, by Jove !\nwe did drink,\u201d said the stout man, once more enjoying\nthe past delights in memory.\n\nFalk had no answer to this, and moreover, his\nthoughts were running in a different groove.\n\n*\u201c\u201cIsn\u2019t it jolly to have a morning off ? \u201d said the tall\nman, who seemed to be playing the part of tempter.\n", "\u201cTt is, indeed ! \u201d replied Falk, trying to measure his\nfreedom, as it were, with a glance through the window ;\nbut all he saw was a fire-escape and a dust-bin in a\nyard which never received more than a faint reflexion\nof the summer sky.\n\n\u201cHalf a pint! That\u2019s it! Ah! Well and what\ndo you say to the \u2018Triton\u2019? Hahaha!\u201d\n\n\u201c Don\u2019t laugh,\u201d said Falk ; \u201c\u2018 many a poor devil will\nsuffer through it.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c Who are the poor devils ? Poor capitalists ? Are\nyou sorry for those who don\u2019t work, but live on the\nproceeds of their money ? No, my boy, you are still\nfull of prejudices! There wasa funny tale in the Hornet\nabout a wholesale merchant, who bequeathed to the\ncr\u00e9che Bethlehem twenty thousand crowns, and was\ngiven the order of Vasa for his munificence ; now it\nhas transpired that the bequest was in \u2018Triton\u2019 shares\nwith joint liability, and so the er\u00e9che is of course\nbankrupt. Isn\u2019t that lovely? The assets were\ntwenty-five cradles and an oil painting by an unknown\nmaster. It\u2019stoofunny! The portrait was valued at\nfive crowns! Hahahaha!\u201d\n\nThe subject of conversation irritated Falk, for he\nknew more of the matter than the two others.\n\n\u201cDid you see that the Red Cap unmasked that\nhumbug Sch\u00e9nstr\u00e9m who published that volume of\nmiserable verses at Christmas ?\u201d said the stout man.\n* It really was a rare pleasure to learn the truth about\nthe rascal. I have more than once given him a sound\nslating in the Copper-Snake.\u201d\n\n\u2018** But you were rather unjust ; his verses were not\nas bad as you said,\u201d\u2019 remarked the tall man.\n\n**Not as bad? They were worse than mine which\nthe Grey Bonnet tore to shreds. Don\u2019t youremember ?\u201d\n\n** By-the-by, Falk, have you been to the theatre in\nthe Deer Park ? \u201d asked the tall man.\n\nee No ! 29\n\n** What a pity! That Lundholm gang of thieves is\nplaying there. Impudent fellow, the director! He\nsent no seats to the Copper-Snake, and when we\n", "arrived at the theatre last night, he turned us out.\nBut he'll pay for it! You give it tothe dog! MHere\u2019s\npaper and pencil. Heading: \u2018Theatre and Music.\nDeer Park Theatre.\u2019 Now, you goon!\u201d\n\n** But I haven\u2019t seen the company.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does that matter ? Have you never written\nabout anything you hadn\u2019t seen ? \u201d\n\n\u201cNo! I\u2019ve unmasked humbugs, but I have never\nattacked unoffending people, and I know nothing\nabout this company.\u201d\n\n\u2018** They are a miserable lot. Just scum,\u201d affirmed\nthe stout man. \u201cSharpen your pen and bruise his\nheel; you are splendid at it.\u201d\n\n\u201c* Why don\u2019t you bruise him yourselves ? \u201d\n\n** Because the printers know our handwriting and\nsome of them walk on in the crowds. Moreover Lund-\nholm is a violent fellow ; he will be sure to invade the\neditorial office ; then it will be a good thing to be able\nto tell him that the criticism is a communication from\nthe public. And while you write up the stage, I will\ndo the concerts. There was a sacred concert last\nweek. oo the man\u2019s name Daubry? With\na y > 2\n\n** No, with an \u2018i,\u2019 \u2019\u2019 corrected the fat man. \u2018* Don\u2019t\nforget that he\u2019s a tenor and sang the \u2018 Stabat Mater.\u2019 \u201d\u2019\n\n** How do you spell it ?\u201d\n\n\u201cTl tell you in a minute.\u201d\n\nThe stout editor of the Copper-Snake took a packet\nof greasy newspapers from the gas-meter.\n\n\u201c*Here\u2019s the whole programme, and, I believe, a\ncriticism as well.\u201d\n\nFalk could not help laughing.\n\n\u201c\u201cHow could a criticism appear simultaneously\nwith the advertisement ? \u201d\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t it? But we shan\u2019t want it; I\nwill criticize that French mob myself. You\u2019d better\ndo the literature, Fatty ! \u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cDo the publishers send books to the Copper-\nSnake ?\u201d\u2019 asked Falk.\n\n** Are you mad ?\u201d\n", "\u201cDo you buy them yourselves for the sake of\nreviewing them ? \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cBuy them? Greenhorn! Have another glass\nand cheer up, and I'll treat you to a chop.\u201d\n\n** Do you read the books which you review ? \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c\u201cWho do you think has time for reading books ?\nIsn\u2019t it enough to write about them? It\u2019s quite\nsufficient to read the papers. Moreover, it\u2019s our\nprinciple to slate everything.\u201d\n\n** An absurd principle ! \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cNot at all! It brings all the author\u2019s enemies\nand enviers on one\u2019s side\u2014and so one\u2019s in the majority.\nThose who are neutral would rather see an author\nslated than praised. \u2018To the nobody there is some-\nthing edifying and comforting in the knowledge that\nthe road to fame is beset with thorns. Don\u2019t you\nthink so ?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may be right. But the idea of playing with\nhuman destinies in this way is terrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! It\u2019s good for young and old; I know that,\nfor I was persistently slated in my young days.\u201d\n\n\u2018* But you mislead public opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe public does not want to have an opinion, it\nwants to satisfy its passions. If I praise your enemy\nyou writhe like a worm and tell me that I have no\njudgment ; if I praise your friend, you tell me that\n{have. \u2018Take that last piece of the Dramatic Theatre,\nFatty, which has just been published in book form.\u201d\u2019\n\n** Are you sure that it has been published ? \u201d\n\n\u201cTamcertain ofit. It\u2019s quite safe to say that there\nisn\u2019t enough action in it; that\u2019s a phrase the public\nknows well ; laugh a little at the \u2018 beautiful language \u2019 ;\nthat\u2019s good, old, disparaging praise ; then attack the\nmanagement for having accepted such a play and point\nout that the moral teaching is doubtful\u2014a very safe\nthing to say about most things. But as you haven\u2019t\nseen the performance, say that want of room compels\nus to postpone our criticism of the acting. Do that,\nand you can\u2019t make a mistake.\u201d\n\n\u2018* Who is the unfortunate author ? \u201d asked Falk.\n", "** Nobody knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink of his parents, his friends, who will read\nyour possibly quite unjust remarks.\u201d\n\n= What's that got to do with the Copper-Snake ?\nThey were hoping to see a friend slated ; they know\nwhat to expect from the Copper-Snake.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c\u201c Have you no conscience ? \u201d\n\n\u201cHas the public which supports us, a conscience ?\nDo you think we could survive if it did not support\nus ? Would you like to hear a a which I\nwrote on the present state of literature ? I can assure\nyou it will give you plenty to think about. I have\nacopy with me. But let us have some stout first.\nWaiter! Here! Now I\u2019m going to give you a\ntreat ; you can profit by it if you like.\u201d\n\n*** We have not heard so much whining in the\nSwedish verse-factory for many years ; this constant\npuling is enough to drive a man into a lunatic asy!um.\nRobust rascals caterwaul like cats in March; they\nimagine that anemia and adenoids will arouse public\ninterest now that consumption is played out. And\nwithal they have backs broad as brewers\u2019 horses and\nfaces red as tapsters. This one whimpers about the\ninfidelity of women, although all he has to go on is\nthe bought loyalty of a wanton ; that one tells us that\nhe has no gold, but that his \u201c harp is all he possesses\nin the world \u2019\u2019\u2014the liar! He has five thousand\ncrowns dividend per annum and the right to an\nendowed chair in the Swedish Academy. A third\nis a faithless, cynical scofier, who cannot open his\nlips without breathing forth his impure spirit and\nbabbling blasphemies. Their verses are not a whit\nbetter than those which thirty years ago clergymen\u2019s\ndaughters sang to the guitar. \u2018They should write for\nconfectioners at a penny a line, and not waste the time\nof publishers, printers, and reviewers with their\nrhymes. What dothey writeabout ? About nothing\nat all, that is to say about themselves. It is bad form\nto talk about oneself, but it is quite the right thing\nto write about oneself. What are they bemoaning ?\n", "Their incapacity to achieve a success? Success?\nThat is the word! Have they produced one single\nthought, capable of benefiting their fellow-creatures ;\nthe age in which they live? If they had but once\nchampioned the cause of the helpless, their sins might\nbe forgiven them; but they have not. Therefore\nthey are as sounding brass\u2014nay, they are as a clanking\npiece of tin and the cracked bell of a fool\u2019s cap\u2014for\nthey have no other love than the love of the next edition\nof their books, the love of the Academy and the love\nof themselves.\u2019 \u201d\u2019\n\n\u201c 'That\u2019s sarcasm, isn\u2019t it ?

Can you?\nHe wields a pen which pierces shoe-leather.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018* Now, lads, stop talking and write ; afterwards you\nshall have coffee and liqueurs.\u201d\n\nAnd they wrote of human merit and human un-\nworthiness and broke hearts as if they were breaking\negg-shells.\n\nFalk felt an indescribable longing for fresh air ; he\nopened the window which looked on the yard ; it was\ndark and narrow like a tomb; all he could see was a\nsmall square of the sky if he bent his head far back.\nHe fancied that he was sitting in his grave, breathing\nbrandy fumes and kitchen smells, eating the funeral\nrepast at the burial of his youth, his principles and\nhis honour. He smelt the elder-blossoms which stood\non the table, but they reeked of decay ; once more he\nlooked out of the window cager to find an object which\nwould not inspire him with loathing ; but there was\nnothing but a newly tarred dust-bin\u2014standing\nlike a coffin\u2014with its contents of cast-off finery and\nbroken litter. His thoughts climbed up the fire-\nescape which seemed to lead from dirt, stench, and\nshame right up into the blue sky; but no angels\nwere ascending and descending, and no love was\nwatching from above\u2014there was nothing but the\nempty, blue void.\n", "Falk took his pen and began to shade the letters of\nthe headline \u2018\u201c\u2018 Theatre,\u201d when a strong hand clutched\nhis arm and a firm voice said :\n\n** Come along, I want to speak to you!\u201d\n\nHe looked up, taken back and ashamed.

Oh, here it is! Come\nalong !\u201d\n\nThey were in the street. Borg took his arm, led\nhim to the nearest square, marched him into a shop\nand bought him a pair of canvas shoes. This done,\nhe drew him across the lock to the harbour. A cutter\nlay there, fast to her moorings, but ready to go to sea ;\nin the cutter sat young Levi reading a Latin grammar\nand munching a piece of bread and butter.\n\n\u201c This,\u201d\u2019 said Borg, \u201cis the cutter Urijah; it\u2019s an\nugly name, but she is a good boat and she is insured\nin the \u2018Triton.\u2019 There sits her owner, the Hebrew lad\nIsaac, reading a Latin grammar\u2014the idiot wants to\ngo to college\u2014and from this moment you are engaged\nas his tutor for the summer\u2014and now we'll be off for\nour summer residence at Nimd6.

If\nthere is anything over after the instalments have been\npaid up, we will divide it equally amongst us. Please\nsend me my share by steamer to Dalar6, where I will\ncall for it.\n\nI have now had Falk under treatment for a month,\nand I believe he is on the road to recovery.\n\nYou will remember that after Olle\u2019s famous lecture\nhe left us abruptly and, instead of making use of his\nbrother and his brother\u2019s connexions, went on the\nstaff of the Workman\u2019s Flag, where he was ill-treated\nfor fifty crowns a month. But the wind of freedom\nwhich blew there must have had a demoralizing effect\non him, for he became morose and neglected his\nappearance. With the help of the girl Beda I kept my\neye on him, and when I considered him ripe for a\nrupture with the communards, I went and fetched him\naway.\n\nI found him in a low public-house called \u2018\u201c\u2018 The\nStar,\u201d in the company of two seandal writers with\nwhom he was drinking brandy\u2014lI believe they were\nwriting at the same time. He was in a melancholy\ncondition, as you would say.\n\nAs you know, I regard mankind with calm in-\n\n290\n", "difference ; men are to me geological preparations,\nminerals ; some crystallize under one condition, others\nunder another; it all depends on certain laws or\ncircumstances which should leave us completely un-\nmoved. I don\u2019t weep over the lime-spar, because it\nis not as hard as a rock-crystal.\n\nTherefore I cannot regard Falk\u2019s condition as\nmelancholy ; it was the outcome of his temperament\n(heart you would say) plus the circumstances which\nhis temperament had created.\n\nBut he was certainly \u2018\u2018 down\u201d when I found him.\nI took him on board our cutter and he remained\npassive. But just as we had pushed off, he turned\nround and saw Beda standing on the shore, beckoning\nto him; I can\u2019t think how she got there. On seeing\nher, our man went clear out of his mind. Put me\nashore ! he screamed, threatening to jump overboard.\nI seized him by the arms, pushed him into the cabin\nand locked the door.\n\nAs we passed Vaxholm, I posted two letters; one\nto the editor of the Workman\u2019s Flag, begging him to\nexcuse Falk\u2019s absence, and the other to his landlady,\nasking her to send him his clothes.\n\nIn the meantime he had calmed down, and when he\nbeheld the sea and the skerries, he became sentimental\nand talked a great deal of nonsense: he had lost all\nhope of ever seeing God\u2019s (?) green earth again, he\nsaid, and so on.\n\nBut presently he began to suffer from something\nlike qualms of conscience. He maintained that he\nhad no right to be happy and take a holiday when\nthere were so many unhappy people in the world ; he\nimagined that he was neglecting his duty towards the\nscoundrel who edits the Workman\u2019s Flag, and begged\nus to row him back. When I talked to him of the\nterrible time he had just gone through, he replied that\nit was the duty of all men to work and suffer for one\nanother. This view had almost become a religion\nwith him, but I have cured him of it with soda water\nand salt baths. He was completely broken, and I had\n", "great difficulty in patching him up, for it was hard to\nsay where the physical trouble ended and the psychical\nbegan.\n\nI must say that in a certain respect he excites my\nastonishment\u2014I won\u2019t say admiration, for I never\nadmire anybody. He seems to suffer from an extra-\nordinary mania which makes him act in direct con-\ntradiction to his own interest. He might have been\nin a splendid position, if he had not thrown up his\ncareer in the Civil Service, particularly as his brother\nwould, in that case have helped him with a sum of\nmoney. Instead of that he cast his reputation to the\nwinds and slaved for a brutal plebeian ; and all for\nthe sake of his ideals! It is most extraordinary !\n\nBut he seems to be mending at last, more par-\nticularly after a lesson he had here. Can you believe\nit, he called the fishermen \u201c sir,\u2019\u2019 and took off his hat\nto them. In addition he indulged in cordial chats\nwith the natives, in order to find out \u201c how these\npeople lived.\u201d\u201d The result was that the fishermen\npricked up their ears, and one of them asked me one\nday whether *\u2018 this Falk \u201d\u2019 paid for his own board, or\nwhether the doctor (I) pee for him? I told Falk\nabout it and it depressed him; he is always despon-\ndent, whenever he is robbed of a delusion. A few\ndays later he talked to our Jandlord on the subject of\nuniversal suffrage; later on our landlord asked me\nwhether Falk was in poor circumstances.\n\nDuring the first few days he ran up and down the\nshore like a madman. Often he swam far out into the\nfj\u00e9rd, as if he never meant to return again. As I\nalways looked upon suicide as the sacred right of every\nindividual, I did not interfere.\n\nIsaac told me that Falk had opencd his heart to him\non the subject of the girl Beda; she seems to have\nmade an awful fool of him.\n\nA a gee of Isaac! He is one of the shrewdest\nfellows ever met. He has, after one month\u2019s study,\nmastered the Latin grammar, and he reads his Cesar\nas we read the Grey Bonnet; and what\u2019s more, he\n", "knows all about it, which we never did. His brain is\nreceptive, that is to say, capable of assimilating know-\nledge, and in addition to this it is practical; this\ncombination has produced many a genius, in spite of\ngross stupidity in many other respects. Every now\nand then he indulges his business instincts ; the other\nday he gave us a brilliant example of his talent in that\ndirection.\n\nI know nothing about his financial position\u2014for in\nthat respect he is very reticent\u2014but a little while ago\nhe had to pay a few hundred crowns. He was very\nfidgety, and as he did not want to apply to his brother\n(of the \u201c\u2018 Triton \u201d\u2019) with whom he is not on friendly terms,\nhe asked me to lend him the sum. I was not in a\nposition to do so. Thereupon he sat down, took a\nsheet of note-paper, wrote a letter and sent it off by\nspecial messenger. For a few days nothing i ae\n\nIn front of our cottage grew a pretty little oakwood\nwhich shaded us from the sun and sheltered us from\nthe strong sea breezes. I don\u2019t know much about\ntrees and things pertaining to nature, but I love to sit\nin the shade when the days are hot. One morning, on\npulling up my blind, I was dumbfounded ; I was look-\ning at the open fj\u00e9rd and a yacht riding at anchor\nabout a cable-length from the shore. Every tree had\ngone, and Isaac was sitting on a stump reading\nEuclid and counting the trunks as they were being\ncarried on board the yacht.\n\nI wakened Falk ; he was furious and had a quarrel\nwith Isaac who made a thousand crowns on the deal.\nOur landlord received two hundred, all he had asked\nfor. I could have killed Isaac, not because he had\nhad the trees cut down, but because I had not thought\nof it first.\n\nFalk said it was unpatriotic, but Isaac swears that\nthe removal of the \u201c\u2018rubbish\u201d\u2019 has improved the\nview ; he declares that he will take a boat next week\nand visit the neighbouring islets with the same object.\n\nOur landlord\u2019s wife cried all day long, but her\nhusband went to Dalar\u00e9 to buy her a new dress; he\n", "remained away for two whole days, and when he\nreturned at last, he was drunk ; there was nothing in\nthe boat, and when his wife asked for the new dress,\nthe fisherman confessed that he had forgotten all\nabout it.\n\nEnough for the present. Write soon and tell me a\nfew new scandals, and be careful how you manipulate\nthe loan.\n\nYour deadly enemy and security,\nH. B.\n\nP.S. I read in the papers that a Civil Service Bank\nis about to be established. Who is going to put\nmoney into it ? Keep an eye on it, so that we can\nplace a bill there when the time comes.\n\nPlease put the following paragraph into the Grey\nBonnet ; it will affect my medical degree.\n\nScientific Discovery: Cand. Med. Henrik Borg,\none of our younger distinguished medical men has,\nwhile engaged in zootomic research on the skerries\nnear Stockholm, discovered a new species of the\nfamily Clypeaster, to which he has given the very\npertinent name of maritimus. Its characteristics may\nbe described as follows: Cutaneous lamin in five\nporous ambulacral shields and five interambulacral\nshields, with warts instead of pricks. The animal has\nexcited much interest in the scientific world.\n\nArvin Fak to BeEpA PETTERSON\nNAmpo6, August 18 \u2014\n\nAs I walk along the seashore and see the roadweed\ngrowing in sand and pebbles, I think of you blossoming\nfor a whole winter in an inn of old Stockholm.\n\nI know nothing more delightful than to lie full\nlength on a cliff and feel the fragments of gneiss\ntickling my ribs while I gaze seaward. It makes me\nfeel proud, and I imagine that I am Prometheus, while\nthe vulture\u2014that is you\u2014has to lie in a feather bed in\nSandberg Street and swallow mercury.\n\nSeaweed is of no use while it grows at the bottom of\n", "the sea ; but when it decays on the shore it smells of\niodine which is a cure for love, and bromide, which is a\ncure for insanity.\nThere was no hell until Paradise was quite complete,\nthat is to say until woman was created (chestnut !).\nFar away, by the open sea, there lives a pair of\neider ducks, in an old quarter cask.

Render an\n", "account at once, else I shall come up to town and\nmake a row.\n\nIhave read the paragraph, which, of course, was not\nwithout errors. It said zoologic instead of zootomic,\nand Crypeaster instead of Clypeaster. Nevertheless,\nI hope it will serve its purpose.\n\nFalk went mad after receiving a letter in a feminine\nhandwriting a day or two ago. One minute he was\nclimbing trees, at the next he was diving to the bottom\nof the sea. I expect it was the crisis\u2014I\u2019ll talk to him\nlike a father a little later on.\n\nIsaac has sold his yacht without asking my per-\nmission, and for this reason we are, at the moment,\nenemies. He is at present reading the second book\nof Livy and founding a Fishing Company.\n\nHe has bought a str6mming-net, a seal-gun, twenty-\nfive pipe stems, a salmon line, two bass-nets, a shed\nfor drag-nets and a\u2014church. The latter seems in-\ncredible, but it is quite true. I admit it was scorched\na little by the Russians in 1719, but the walls are still\nstanding. The parish possesses a new one which\nserves the ordinary purpose ; the old one was used as\na parochial store-room. Isaac is thinking of making\nthe Academy a present of it, in the hope of receiving\nthe order of Vasa.\n\nThe latter has been given for less. Isaac\u2019s uncle,\nwho is an innkeeper, received it for treating the deaf\nand dumb to bread and butter and beer when they\nused the riding-ground in the autumn. He did it for\nsix years. Then he received his reward. Now he\ntakes no more notice of the deaf and dumb, which\nproves how fatal the order of Vasa may be under\ncertain circumstances.\n\nUnless I drown the rascal Isaac, he won\u2019t rest until\nhe has bought all Sweden.\n\nPull yourself together and behave like an honour-\nable man, or I shall bear down upon you like Jehu, and\nthen you'll be lost.\n\nH..

Seems to\nhave been exchanged, for the Architects\u2019 Bank always\npays in Scanian bills of fifty. However, never mind !\n\nFalk is well; he has passed the crisis like a man ;\nhe has regained his self-confidence\u2014a most important\nquality as far as worldly success goes, but a quality\nwhich, according to statistics is considerably weakened\nin children who lose their mothers at an early age.\nI gave him a prescription which he promised to try all\nthe more readily as the same idea had occurred to him.\nHe will return to his former profession, but without\naccepting his brother\u2019s help\u2014his last act of folly of\nwhich I do not approve\u2014re-enter society, register his\nname with the rest of the cattle, become respectable,\nmake himself a social position, and hold his tongue\nuntil his word bears weight.\n\nThe latter is absolutely necessary, if he is to remain\nalive ; he has a tendency to insanity, and is bound to\nlose his reason unless he forgets all about these ideas\nwhich I really cannot understand; and I don\u2019t\nbelieve that he himself could define what it is he wants.\n\nHe has begun the cure and I am amazed at his\nprogress. I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll end as a member of the\nRoyal Household.\n\nThat is what I believed until a few days ago when\nhe read in a paper an account of the Commune at\nParis. He at once had a relapse and took to climbing\ntrees again. He got over it, though, and now he does\nnot dare to look at a paper. But he never says a\nword.

So,\nfor instance, he dared to contradict the pastor the\nother day while playing a game of draughts with him,\nand maintain that the Jews had invented Christianity\nand that all those baptized were really Jews.

We\nare returning to town on Monday.\n", "CHAPTER XXVII\nRECOVERY\nIv was autumn again. Ona clear November morning\nArvid Falk was walking from his elegantly furnished\nrooms in Great Street to . . . man\u2019s Boarding School\nnear Charles XII Market, where he had an appoint-\nment as master of the Swedish language and history.\n\nDuring the autumn months he had made his way\nback into civilized society, a proceeding which had\nbrought home to him the fact that he had become a\nperfect savage during his wanderings. He had dis-\ncarded his disreputable hat and bought a high one\nwhich he found difficult, at first, to keep on his\nhead; he had bought gloves, but in his savagery\nhe had replied \u201c fifteen \u2019\u2019 when the shopgirl asked\nfor his size, and blushed when his reply brought a\nsmile to the face of every girl in the shop.\n\nThe fashion had changed, since he had last bought\nclothes; as he was walking through the streets, he\nlooked upon himself as a dandy, and every now and\nthen examined his reflexion in the shop windows, to\nsee whether his garments set well.\n\nNow he was strolling up and down the pavement\nbefore the Dramatic Theatre and waiting for the\nclock on St. James\u2019 Church to strike nine; he felt\nuneasy and embarrassed, as if he were a schoolboy\ngoing to school himself ; the pavement was so short,\nand as again and again he retraced his footsteps he\ncompared himself to a dog on a chain.\n\nFor a moment he had a wild thought of taking a\nwider range, a very much wider range, for if he\nwent straight on, he would come to Lill-Jans, and\n\n299\n", "he remembered the spring morning when that very\npavement had led him away from society, which he\ndetested, into liberty, nature, and\u2014slavery.\n\nIt struck nine. He stood in the corridor; the\nschoolroom doors were closed; in the twilight he\nsaw a long row of children\u2019s garments hanging against\nthe wall: hats, boas, bonnets, wraps, gloves, and\nmuffs were lying on tables and window sills, and\nwhole regiments of button boots and _ overshoes\nstood on the floor. But there was no smell of damp\nclothes and wet leather as in the halls of the Parlia-\nmentary Buildings and in the Working-men\u2019s Union\n** Phoenix,\u201d or\u2014he became conscious of a faint odour\nof newly mown hay\u2014it seemed to come from a little\nmuff lined with blue silk and trimmed with tassels,\nwhich looked like a white kitten with black dots.\nHe could not resist taking it in his hand and smelling\nthe perfume\u2014new-mown hay\u2014when the front door\nopened and a little girl of about ten came in accom-\npanied by a maid.\n\nShe looked at the master with big fearless eyes,\nand dropped a coquettish little curtsey ; the almost\nembarrassed master replied with a bow which made\nthe little beauty smile\u2014and the maid, too. She was\nlate ; but she was quite unconcerned and allowed her\nmaid to take off her outdoor garments and overshoes\nas calmly as if she had come to a dance.\n\nFrom the classroom came a sound which made his\nheart beat\u2014what was it? Ah! The organ\u2014the\nold organ! a legion of children\u2019s voices were singing\n** Jesus, at the day\u2019s beginning. .. .\u201d He felt ill at\nease, and forced himself to fix his mind on Borg and\nIsaac in order to control his feelings.\n\nBut matters went from bad to worse: \u2018\u2018 Our\nFather, which art in Heaven...\u201d The old prayer\n\u2014it was long ago. .. .\n\nThe silence was so profound that he could hear the\nraising of all the little heads and the rustling of\ncollars and pinafores ; the doors were thrown open ;\nhe looked at a huge, moving flower-bed composed of\n", "little girls between eight and fourteen. He felt self-\nconscious like a thief caught in the act, when the\nold headmistress shook hands with him; the flowers\nwaved to and fro, and there was much excited\nwhispering and exchanging of significant glances.\n\nHe sat down at the end of a long table, surrounded\nby twenty fresh faces with coating eyes; twenty\nchildren who had never experienced the bitterest of\nall sorrows, the humiliations of poverty; they met\nhis glance boldly and inquisitively, but he was\nembarrassed and had to pull himself together with\nan effort ; before long, however, he was on friendly\nterms with Anna and Charlotte, Georgina and Lizzy\nand Harry; teaching was a pleasure. He made\nallowances, and let Louis xiv and Alexander be\ntermed great men, like all others who had been\nsuccessful; he permitted the French Revolution to\nbe called a terrible event, during which the noble\nLouis XVI and the virtuous Marie Antoinette perished\nmiserably, and so on.\n\nWhen he entered the office of the Board of Purvey-\nance of Hay for the Cavalry Regiments, he felt\naap, and refreshed. He stayed till eleven reading\nthe Conservative; then he went to the offices of the\nCommittee on Brandy Distilleries, lunched, and\nwrote two letters, one to Borg and one to Struve.\n\nOn the stroke of one he was in the Department for\nDeath Duties. Here he collated an assessment of\nproperty which brought him in a hundred crowns ;\nhe had time enough before dinner to read the proofs\nof the revised edition of the Forest Laws, which he\nwas editing.\n\nIt struck three. Anybody crossing the Riddarhus\nMarket at that time could have met on the bridge a\nyoung, important-looking man, with pockets bulging\nwith manuscripts, and hands crossed on his back ;\nhe is strolling slowly along, accompanied by an\nelderly, lean, grey-haired man of fifty, the actuary\nof the dead. The estate of every citizen who dies\nhas to be declared to him; according to the amount\n", "302 JHE RED ROOM\n\nhe takes his percentage ; some say that this is his\nduty ; others that he represents the Earth, and has\nto watch that the dead take nothing away with them,\nas everything is a loan\u2014without interest. In any\nease, he is a man more interested in the dead than\nthe living, and therefore Falk likes his company ;\nhe, on the other hand, is attached to Falk because,\nlike himself, he collects coins and autographs, and\nbecause he possesses that excellent quality, toler-\nance, which is rarely found in a young man.\n\nThe two friends enter the Restaurant Rosengren,\nwhere they are fairly certain not to meet young men\nand where they can discuss numismatics and auto-\ngraphy. They take their coffee in the Caf\u00e9 Rydberg\nand look at catalogues of coins until six. At six\no\u2019clock the official Post appears, and they read the\npromotions.\n\nEach enjoys the other\u2019s company, for they never\nquarrel. Falk is so free from fixed opinions that he\nis the most amiable man in the world, liked and\nappreciated by chiefs and colleagues.\n\nOccasionally they dine in the Hamburg Exchange\nand take a liqueur or two at the Opera Restaurant,\nand to see them walking along arm in arm, at cleven\no\u2019clock, is really quite an edifying sight.\n\nMoreover, Falk has become a regular guest at\nfamily dinners and suppers in houses into which\nBorg\u2019s father has introduced him. The women find\nhim interesting, although they do not know how to\ntake him; he is always smiling and expert at\nsarcastic little pleasantries.\n\nBut when he is sick of family life and the social\nlife, he visits the Red Room, and there he meets the\nredoubtable Borg, his admirer Isaac, his secret enemy\nand envier Struve, the man who never has any\nmoney, and the sarcastic Sell\u00e9n, who is gradually\npreparing his second success, after all his imitators\nhave accustomed the public to his manner.\n\nLundell, who, after the completion of his altar-picce,\ngave up painting sacred pictures and became a fat\n", "Epicurean, only comes to the Red Room when he\nhas no money to pay for his dinner; he makes a\nliving by portrait painting, a profession which brings\nhim countless invitations to dinners and suppers ;\nLundell maintains that these invitations are essential\nfor making character studies.\n\nOlle, who is still employed by the stonemason, has\nbecome a gloomy misanthrope after his great failure\nas a politician and orator. He refuses \u2018\u2018to impose\non \u201d\u2019 his former friends and lives a solitary life.\n\nFalk is in a boisterous, riotous mood whenever he\nvisits the Red Room, and Borg is of opinion that he\ndoes him credit ; he is a veritable sappeur to whom\nnothing is sacred\u2014except politics ; this is a subject\non which he never touches. But if, while he lets off\nhis fireworks for the amusement of his friends, he\nshould catch, through the dense tobacco smoke. a\nglimpse of the morose Olle on the other side of the\nroom, his mood changes, he becomes gloomy like a\nnight on the sea, and swallows large quantities of\nstrong liquor, as if he wanted to extinguish a\nsmouldering fire.\n\nBut Olle has not been seen for a long time.\n", "CHAPTER XXVIII\nFROM BEYOND THE GRAVE\nTHE snow was falling lightly and silently, clothing\nthe street in pure white, as Falk and Sell\u00e9n were\nwalking to the infirmary in the south-eastern suburb\nof Kingsholm, to call for Borg on their way to the\nRed Room.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s strange that the first snow should create an\nalmost solemn impression,\u201d said Sell\u00e9n. \u2018 The dirty\nground is transformed to... .\u201d\u2019\n\n** Are you sentimental ? \u2019\u2019 scoffed Falk.\n\n\u201c\u201cOh, no! I was merely talking from the point of\nview of a landscape painter.\u201d\n\nThey continued their way in silence, wading\nthrough the whirling snow.\n\n\u201cThe Kingsholm with its infirmaries always strikes\nme as uncanny,\u2019 remarked Falk, after a pause.\n\n** Are you sentimental ? \u201d scoffed Sell\u00e9n.\n\n\u201c* Not at all, but this part of the town always makes\nthat impression on me.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018** Nonsense! It doesn\u2019t make any impression at\nall; you imagine it does. Here we are, and Borg\u2019s\nwindows are lit up. Perhaps he\u2019s got some nice\ncorpses to-night.\u201d\n\nThey were standing before the door of the institute.\nThe huge building with its many dark windows glared\nat them as if it were inquiring what they wanted\nat that hour of the night. They passed the round\nflower bed, and entered the small building on the right.\n\nAt the very back of the room Borg was sitting\nalone in the lamplight, working at the mutilated body\nof a man who had hanged himself.\n\n304\n", "\u201cGood evening,\u2019 said Borg, laying aside his\nknife. \u2018* Would you like to see an old friend ? \u201d\n\nHe did not wait for the answer\u2014which was not\nforthcoming\u2014but lighted a lantern, took his over\ncoat and a bunch of keys.\n\n\u201c1 didn\u2019t know that we had any friends here,\u2019\u2019\nsaid Sell\u00e9n, desperately clinging to a flippant mood.\n\n\u201cCome along ! \u201d\u2019 said Borg.\n\nThey crossed the yard and entered the large\nbuilding; the creaking door closed behind them,\nand the little piece of candle, a remnant from the\nlast ecard party, threw its red, feeble glimmer on the\nwhite walls. The two strangers tried to read Borg\u2019s\nface, wondering whether he was up to some trick,\nbut the face was inscrutable.\n\nThey turned to the left and went along a passage\nwhich echoed to their footsteps in a way which sug-\ngested that they were being followed. Falk kept close\nbehind Borg and tried to keep Sell\u00e9n at his back.\n\n** Over there!\u201d said Borg, standing still in the\nmiddle of the passage.\n\nNobody could see anything but walls. But they\nheard a low trickling sound, like the falling of a gentle\nrain and became aware of a strange odour, resembling\nthe smell of a damp flower-bed or a pine-wood in\nOctober.\n\n\u201cTo the right ! \u201d\u2019 said Borg.\n\nThe right wall was made of glass, and behind it,\non their backs, lay three white bodies.\n\nBorg selected a key, opened the glass door, and\nentered.\n\n\u2018** Here!\u201d he said, standing still before the second\nof the three.\n\nIt was Olle. He lay there as quietly, with his\nhands folded across his chest, as if he were taking an\nafternoon nap. His drawn-up lips created the\nimpression that he was smiling. He was well-\npreserved.\n\n** Drowned ?\u201d\u2019 asked Sell\u00e9n, who was the first to\nregain his self-possession.\n\nU\n", "*\u201c Drowned,\u201d echoed Borg. \u201cCan either of you\nidentify his clothes ?\u201d\n\nThree miserable suits were hanging against the\nwall. Sell\u00e9n at once picked out the right one; a\nblue jacket with sporting buttons, and a pair of\nblack trousers, rubbed white at the knees.\n\n** Are you certain ?\u201d\n\n** Ought to know my own coat\u2014which I borrowed\nfrom Falk.\u201d\n\nSell\u00e9n drew a pocket-book from the breast pocket\nof the jacket, it was saturated with water and covered\nwith green alge, which Borg called enteromorph.\nHe opened it by the light of the lantern and examined\nits contents\u2014two or three overdue pawntickets and\na bundle of papers tied together, on which was\nwritten : To him who cares to read.\n\n\u201cHave you seen enough ?\u201d asked Borg. \u2018\u2018 Then\nlet\u2019s go and have a drink.\u201d\n\nThe three mourners (friend was a word only used\nby Levin and Lundell when they wanted to borrow\nmoney) went to the nearest public-house as repre-\nsentatives of the Red Room.\n\nBeside a blazing fire and behind a battery of\nbottles, Borg began the perusal of the papers which\nOlle had left behind, but more than once he had to\nhave recourse to Falk\u2019s skill as an \u201c autographer,\u201d\u2019\nfor the water had washed away the words here and\nthere; it looked as if the writer\u2019s tears had fallen\non the sheets, as Sell\u00e9n facetiously remarked.\n\n** Stop talking now,\u201d said Borg, emptying his glass\nof grog with a grimace which exhibited all his back\nteeth ; \u2018\u2018 lam going to read, and I beg of you not to\ninterrupt me.\n\n*\u201c*To Him wHo CARES TO Reap.\n\n\u201c\u201c*] have a right to take my life, all the more so\nbecause not only does my act not interfere with the\ninterests of a fellow-creature, but rather it contri-\nbutes to the happiness, as it is called, of at least\n", "one person; a place and four hundred cubic feet of\nair will become vacant.\n\n\u201c\u201c*My motive is not despair, for an intelligent\nindividual never despairs, but I take this step with\na fairly calm conscience; that an act of this kind\nthrows one\u2019s mind into a certain state of excitement\nwill be easily understood by everybody; to post-\npone it from fear of what might come hereafter is\nonly worthy of a slave clutching at any excuse, so\nthat he might stay in a world where he cannot have\nsuffered much. At the thought of going, a burden\nseems to fall from my shoulders; I cannot fare\nworse, I might fare better. If there is no life beyond\nthe grave, death must be happiness; as great a\nhappiness at least as sleep in a soft bed after hard\nphysical labour. Nobody who has ever observed\nhow sleep relaxes every muscle, and how the soul\ngradually steals away, can fear death.\n\n*** Why does humanity make so much ado about\ndeath ? Because it has burrowed so deeply into the\nearth, that a tearing away from it is bound to be\npainful. I put off from the shore long ago; I have\nno family bonds, no social, national, or legal ties\nwhich could hold me back, and I\u2019m going simply\nbecause life has no longer any attraction for me.\n\n***T do not want to encourage those who are well\ncontent to follow my example; they have no reason\nto do so, and therefore they cannot judge my act.\nI have not considered the point whether it is cowardly\nor not\u2014to that aspect of the question I am indifferent ;\nmoreover, it is a private matter; I never asked to\ncome here and therefore I have a right to go when\nI please.\n\n\u201c\u201c*My reason for going? There are so many\nreasons and they are so complicated that I have\nneither the time nor the ability to explain them.\nI will only mention the most obvious, those which\nhad the greatest influence on myself and on my act.\n\n*\u201c* My childhood and youth were one Jong con-\ntinuation of manual labour; you who do not know\n", "what it means to labour from sunrise to sunset, only\nto fall into a heavy sleep when the toil is over, you\nhave escaped the curse of the fall, for it is a curse\nto fecl one\u2019s spiritual growth arrested while one\u2019s\nbody sinks deeper and deeper into the earth. A man\nwho walks behind the ploughing cattle day in day\nout, and sees nothing but the grey clouds, will end by\nforgetting the blue sky above his head ; a man who\ntakes a spade and digs a hole while the sun scorches\nhis skin, will feel that he is sinking into the parched\nground and digging a grave for his soul. You know\nnothing of this, you who play all day long, and work\na little only during an idle hour between luncheon\nand dinner ; you who rest your spirit when the earth\nis green and enjoy nature as an ennobling and\nelevating spectacle. The toiler on the land never\nsees the spirit of Nature. To him the field is bread,\nthe forest timber, the sea a wash-tub, the meadow\ncheese and milk\u2014everything is earth, soulless earth !\n\n*** When I saw one-half of humanity engaged in\nfostering their spiritual growth, while the other half had\nmerely time to attend to their bodily needs, I thought\nat first that there existed two laws for two different\nspecies of man. But my intellect denied this. My\nspirit rebelled and I resolved that I, too, would escape\nthe curse of the fall\u2014I became an artist.\n\n\u201c*\u00a5 can analyse the much-talked-of artistic\ninstinct because I was endowed with it myself. It\nrests on a broad base of longing for freedom, freedom\nfrom profitable labour; for this reason a German\nphilosopher defined Beauty as the Unprofitable ; as\nsoon as a work of art is of practical use, betrays a\npurpose or a tendency its beauty vanishes. Further-\nmore the instinct rests on pride ; man wants to play\nGod in art, not that he wants to create anything new\u2014\nhe can\u2019t do that\u2014but because he wants to improve,\nto arrange, to recreate. He does not begin by admiring\nhis model, Nature, but by criticizing it. LKverything\nis full of faults and he longs to correct them.\n\n\u201cThis pride, spurring a man on to never-ceasing\n", "effort, and the freedom from work\u2014the curse of the\nfall\u2014beget in the artist the illusion that he is standing\nabove his fellow creatures; to a certain extent this\nis truc, but unless he were constantly recalling this\nfact he would find himself out, that is to say find the\nunreal in his activity and the unjustifiable in his\nescape from the profitable. \u2018This constant need of\nappreciation of his unprofitable work makes him vain,\nrestless, and often deeply unhappy; as soon as he\ncomes to a clear understanding of himself he becomes\nunproductive and goes under, for only the religious\nmind can return to slavery after having once tasted\nfreedom.\n\n\u201c\u201c*To differentiate between genius and talent, to\nlook upon genius as a separate quality, is nonsense,\nand argues a faith in special manifestation. The great\nartist is endowed with a certain amount of ability\nto acquire some kind of technical skill. Without\npractice his ability dies. Somebody has said: genius\nis the infinite capacity for taking pains. \u2018lhis is, like\nso many other things, a half-truth. If culture be\nadded\u2014a rare thing because knowledge makes all\nthings clear, and the cultured man therefore rarely\nbecomes an artist\u2014and a sound intellect, the result\nis genius, the natural product of a combination of\nfavourable circumstances.\n\n***T soon lost faith in the sublime character of my\nhobby\u2014heaven forbid that I should call it my pro-\nfession\u2014for my art was incapable of expressing a\nsingle idea ; at the most it could represent the body\nin a position expressing an emotion accompanying a\nthought\u2014or, in other words, express a thought at\nthird hand. It is like signalling, meaningless to all\nwho cannot read thesignals. I onlysee a red flag, but\nthe soldier sees the word of command: Advance!\nAfter all, even Plato, who was a fine intellectualist and\nan idealist into the bargain, realized the futility of art,\ncalling it but the semblance of a semblance (-reality) ;\nwherefore he excluded the artist from his ideal state.\nHe was in earnest |\n", "\u201c\u201c*T tried to find my way back into slavery, but I\ncould not. I tried to find in it my most sacred duty ;\nI tried to resign myself, but I did not sueceed. My soul\nwas taking harm, and I was on the way to becoming a\nbeast ; there were times when I fancied that all this\ntoil was a positive sin, in as far as it checked the greater\naim of spiritual development ; at such times I played\ntruant for a day, and fled to nature, absorbed in\nunspeakably blissful meditations. But then again\nthis bliss appeared to me in the light of a selfish pleasure\nas great, greater even, than the pleasure I used to feel\nin my artistic work; conscience, the sense of duty,\novertook me like a fury and drove me back to my yoke,\nwhich then seemed beautiful\u2014for a day.\n\n** \u00a9 'T\u2019o escape from this unbearable state of mind, and\nwin light and peace, I go to face the Unknown.

I reread Luther\u2019s Catechism in those days ;\nI made a few annotations, and drafted a plan for a\nnew Catechism.

The reason why parents (more espe-\ncially fathers) hate their children so much more\nfrequently than they love them arises from the fact\nthat the presence of children has an adverse influence\non the financial position of the parents.

If I\nwere acting on my principles, I should begin with\nmyself; but as I had better conform to the rules of\npoliteness laid down by civilized society\u2014seeing that\nI am about to go out into the world to earn my own\nliving\u2014I will begin with you.\n\nI heartily congratulate you on the success of your\nrecently exhibited picture. Isaac took the notice to\nthe Grey Bonnet, and it was printed without the\nknowledge of the editor, who was furious when he\nread it; he had firmly made up his mind that you\nshould be a failure. But now that your genius has\nbeen acknowledged abroad, you are famous at home\ntoo, and I need no longer be ashamed of you.\n\nIn order to forget nothing, and to be as brief as\npossible\u2014for I am lazy as well as tired after a day\u2019s\nwork at the hospital\u2014I will write my letter in the\nshape of a report and the style of the Grey Bonnet ;\nthis will have the additional advantage that you can\nmore easily skip those parts which do not interest you.\n\nThe political situation is becoming\nmore and more interesting ; all parties have corrupted\none another by presents and counter-presents, and now\nall of them are grey. This reaction will probably end\nin Socialism. \u2018There is a talk of increasing the number\nof the districts to forty-eight, and the Ministerial\ncareer is the one which offers the best chances of\n\n314\n", "\u2014 more especially as a man need not even\n\nve passed the examination of an elementary school-\nteacher. I met a school-friend the other day who is\nalready a pensioned Cabinet Minister; he told me\nthat it was far easier to become a Minister than a\nsecretary of one of the departments; they say the\nwork is very much like the work of a man who signs\nguarantees\u2014it is only a matter of a signature now\nand then! It doesn\u2019t matter so much about the\npayment, there is always a second guarantor.\n\nThe Press\u2014well, you know the Press.\nRoughly speaking it is just business, that is to say,\nit always adopts the opinion of the majority, and\nthe majority, or, in other words, the greater number of\nsubscribers, is reactionary. One day I asked a\nLiberal journalist how it was that he wrote in such\nlaudatory terms about you, of whom he knew nothing.\nHe said it was because public opinion, i.e. the largest\nnumber of subscribers, was on your side.\n\n** But supposing public opinion turned against\nhim ?\u201d I asked.\n\n\u201cThen, of course,\u201d he said, \u201c\u2018I shall turn against\nhim too.\u201d\n\nYou will understand that under these circumstances\nthe whole generation which grew up after 1865, and\nwhich is not represented in Parliament, is in despair ;\nand therefore they are either Nihilists\u2014in other\nwords, they don\u2019t care a d\u2014\u2014 for anything\u2014or\nthey find their advantage in turning Conservative.\nTo be a Liberal in these days is the devil\u2019s own job.\n\nThe financial position is depressed.\nThe supply of bills, mine at least, reduced; no bank\nwill look at the safest bills, even if they are signed by\ntwo doctors.\n\nThe \u201cTriton\u201d went into liquidation, as you know.\nDirectors and liquidators took over the printed shares,\nbut the shareholders and depositors received a number\nof lithographed ones from the well-known society at\nNorrk\u00e9ping, which alone managed to weather this\nperiod of frauds and swindles. I met a widow who\n", "had a handful of papers connected with a marble\nquarry ; they were large, beautiful sheets, printed\nin red and blue, on which 1000 Cr., 1000 Cr., was\nengraved ; and below the figures, just as if they were\nstanding security, appeared the names of well-known\npersons ; three of them, at least, are knights of the\nOrder of the Seraphim.\n\nNicholas Falk, the friend and brother, sick\nof his private money-lending business, because it\ndetracted from the full value of his civic authority,\nwhich is far from being the case when the business\nis a public one, decided to combine with a few experts(?)\nand found a bank. \u2018The novel feature of the under-\ntaking was expressed as follows :\n\n{ ** As experience\u2014truly a melancholy experience \u201d\n(Levin is the author, as you may guess) \u201c has proved\nthat deposit receipts are not in themselves a sufficient\nguarantee for the return of deposits\u2014that is deposited\nmoney\u2014we, the undersigned, actuated by unselfish\nzeal for the welfare of home industry, and desirous\nof giving greater security to the well-to-do public,\nhave founded a bank, under the title of \u2018 Deposit\nGuarantee Society Limited.\u2019 The novel and safe\nfeature of the enterprise\u2014and not everything new is\nsafe\u2014consists in the fact that the depositors instead\nof receiving deposit receipts, are given securities to\nthe full value of the deposited sums, ete. ete.\u201d\n\nThey do a brisk business, and you may imagine\nwhat sort of securities they issue instead of deposit\nreceipts.\n\nLevin. Falk, with his keen eye for business,\nrecognized at once the great advantage to be reaped\nfrom the services of a man with Levin\u2019s experience\nand colossal knowledge of people, acquired through his\nmoney-lending business. But to train him for all\neventualities, and make him familiar with all the\nby-ways of the business, he felled him to the ground\nwith his promissory note, and forced him into bank-\nruptcy. Having done so, he appeared in the r\u00e9le of\nhis saviour and made him his confidential clerk with\n", "the title of secretary. And now Levin is installed in a\nlittle private office ; but on no account is he permitted\nto show his face in the bank.\n\nIsaac Levi is employed in the same bank as cashier.\nHe passed his examinations (with Latin, Greek and\nHebrew) first class in all subjects. The Grey Bonnet,\nof course, reported his achievements. Now he is\nreading for the law, and doing a little business on his\nown account. He is like the eel; he has nine lives\nand lives on nothing. He takes no alcohol ; he does\nnot smoke ; I don\u2019t know whether he has any vices,\nbut he is formidable. He has an ironmongers shop\nat Hern\u00e9sand, a tobacconists at Helsingf\u00e9rs, and a\nfancy goods shop at Sddertelje ; in addition he owns a\nfew cottages at Stockholm, S. People say he is the\ncoming man ; I say the man has come.\n\nAfter the winding-up of the \u201c Triton,\u2019 his brother\nretired with a considerable fortune, I am told, and\nis now doing business privately. I heard that he\nproposed buying the forest monastery near Upsala,\nand rebuilding it in a new style invented by his uncle\nof the Academy of Arts. But his offer was refused.\nLevi, very much offended, sent a notice to the Grey\nBonnet under the heading: \u201c\u2018 Persecution of the Jews\nin the Nineteenth Century.\u201d It won him the lively\nsympathy of the whole cultured public; the affair\nwould win him a seat in Parliament if he cared for that\ndistinction. A vote of thanks was presented to him\nby his co-religionists\u2014(as if Levi had any religion)\nwhich was printed in the Grey Bonnet. They thanked\nhim for standing up for the rights of the Jews (to buy\nthe forest monastery). The address was handed to\nhim at a banquet, to which also a great many Swedes\n(I always refer the Jewish question to its rightful\ndomain, the ethnographical one) had been bidden, to\nfeast on bad salmon and uncorked wine. The deeply\nmoved hero of the day (vide Grey Bonnet) received on\nthe same occasion a present of 20,000 crowns (in\nshares) for the foundation of a Home for Fallen\nBoys of the Evangelical Denomination.\n", "I was present at the banquet, and saw a sight I had\nnever seen before\u2014I saw Isaac the worse for drink !\nHe shouted that he hated me, and you, and Falk, and\nall \u2018\u2018 Whites\u2019; he alternately called us \u2018 whites,\u201d\nand \u201c\u2018 natives,\u2019\u2019 and roche ; I had never heard the last\nword before, but no sooner had he uttered it than a\nlarge number of \u201c\u2018 blacks \u201d\u2019 crowded round us, looking\nso ominous that Isaac thought it better to take me\ninto an adjoining room. There he poured out all his\nsoul to me; he spoke of his sufferings as a schoolboy ;\nof the ill-treatment to which master and school-\nfellows had subjected him, the daily knocks and cuffs\nfrom the street arabs. But what roused my indigna-\ntion more than anything else was an incident which\nhad happened to him during his military service ; he\nwas called up to the front at vespers and ordered to\nrecite the Lord\u2019s Prayer. As he did not know it, he\nwas scoffed and jeered at. His account made me\nchange my opinion of him and his race.\n\nReligious swindle and charitable fraud are more\nrampant than ever, and make life in our country very\nunpleasant. You will remember two imps of Satan,\nMrs. Falk and Mrs. Homan, the two pettiest, vainest\nand most malicious creatures who ever idled away their\ndays. You know the er\u00e9che they had founded and its\nend. Their latest achievement is a Home for Fallen\nWomen, and the first inmate\u2014received on my re-\ncommendation\u2014was Marie! The poor girl had lent\nall her savings to a fellow who absconded with them.\nShe was only too happy to find a home where\nshe would be kept free of charge, and be able to\nretrieve her character. She told me that she did\nnot mind all the religious palaver, which is, unfor-\ntunately, inseparable from an enterprise of this sort,\nas long as she could count on her cup of coffee in\nthe morning.\n\nThe Rev. Skore, whom you will no doubt re-\nmember, has not been made pastor primarius, and\nfrom sheer annoyance he is begging for funds to build\nanew chureh.

The church, which\nis to be three times the size of the church on the\nBlasieholm and connected with a sky-high tower, is to\nbe built on the old site of St. Catherine\u2019s. The latter\nis supposed to be too small to satisfy the great\nspiritual needs from which the Swedish nation is\nsuffering at the moment, and is, therefore, to be pulled\ndown. The sum collected has already reached such\ndimensions that a treasurer had to be appointed (with\nfree lodging and fuel). Who do you think is the\ntreasurer ? You would never guess! Struve!\n\nStruve has become somewhat religious these days\n\u2014I say somewhat, because it is not much\u2014only just\nenough for his position, for he is patronized by the\nfaithful. This does, however, not interfere with his\njournalism and his drinking. But his heart is not\nsoft, on the contrary, he is most bitter against all\nthose\u2019 who have not come down; between you and\nme, he has very much deteriorated ; therefore he\nhates you and Falk, and he has sworn to slate you\nnext time you are heard of. He had to submit to the\nmarriage ceremony for the sake of the free lodging and\nfuel. He was married to his wife in the White\nMountains. I was one of the witnesses. His wife,\ntoo, has been converted, for she is under the im-\npression that religion is good form.\n\nLundell has left the religious sphere, and is painting\nnothing but portraits of directors ; he has been made\nassistant at the Academy of Arts. He has also be-\ncome immortal, for he has managed to smuggle a\npainting of his into the National Museum. It was\naccomplished by a vey simple trick and ought to\nencourage imitators. Smith made a present to the\nNational Museum of one of Lundell\u2019s genre pictures, a\nservice which Lundell repaid by painting his portrait\ngratis! Splendid! Isn\u2019t it ?\n\nThe end of a romance. One Sunday morning,\nat the hour when the Sabbath peace is not disturbed\nby the terrible church bells, I was sitting in my room,\n", "smoking. There was a knock at the door, and a tall,\nwell-made man, whose face seemed familiar to me,\nentered\u2014it was Rehnhjelm. We cross-examined cach\nother. He is manager of a large factory and quite\nsatisfied with his lot.\n\nPresently there was another knock. It was Falk.\n(More of him later on.)\n\nWe revived old memories and discussed mutual\nfriends. But by and by there was a pause, that\nstrange silence which so frequently occurs after a\nlively conversation. Rehnhjelm took up a_ book,\nturned over the leaves and read out ;\n\n\u201c\u201c A Cesarean Operation: An academic treatise\nwhich, with the permission of the illustrious medical\nfaculty, will be publicly discussed in the little lecture\nroom of the University.\u201d\u201d What horrible diagrams !\nWho in the world is the unfortunate being cursed thus\nto haunt the living after his death ? \u201d\n\n** You will find it on page 2,\u201d\u2019 I said.\n\nHe went on reading.\n\n\u201cThe pelvis which, as No. 38, is preserved in the\npathological collection of the Academy. . . .\u201d?>\u00bb No\u2014\nthat can\u2019t be it. \u2018\u201c\u2018 Agnes Rundgren, spinster. . . .\u201d\n\nThe man\u2019s face turned as white as chalk. He got\nup and drank some water.\n\n\u201cDid you know the woman ?\u201d\u2019 I asked, in order to\ndistract his thoughts.\n\n** Pid I know her? She was on the stage, and I\nknew her at X-k6ping ; after leaving X-k\u00e9ping, she\nwas engaged in a Stockholm caf\u00e9, under the name of\nBeda Petterson.\u201d\n\nThen you should have seen Falk! It came to a\nscene which ended in Rehnhjelm\u2019s cursing all women,\nand Falk, greatly excited, replying, that there were\ntwo kinds of women, which differed from cach other as\nmuch as angels and devils. He was so moved that\nRehnhjelm\u2019s eyes filled with tears.\n\nAnd now to Falk! I purposely left him to the last.\nIle is engaged to be married! How did it happen ?\nHe himself says: \u2018* We just met one another ! \u201d\n", "As you know, I have no rigid opinions, but cultivate\nan open mind ; but from what I have seen up to now,\nit is undeniable that love is something of which we\nbachelors know nothing\u2014what we call love is nothing\nbut frivolity. You may laugh if you like, you old\nscoffer !\n\nOnly in very bad plays have I seen such a rapid\ndevelopment of character, as I had occasion to watch\nin Falk. You won\u2019t be surprised to hear that his\nengagement was not all plain sailing. The girl\u2019s\nfather, an old widower, a selfish army pensioner,\nlooked upon his daughter as an investment, hoping\nthat she would marry well and thereby secure him a\ncomfortable old age. (Nothing at all unusual!) He\ntherefore bluntly refused his consent. You should\nhave seen Falk! He called on the old man again and\nagain ; he was kicked out, and yet he called again and\ntold the old egoist to the face that he would marry his\ndaughter without his consent, if he continued to\nobject. Iam not sure, but I believe it actually came\nto fisticuffs.\n\nOne evening Falk had accompanied his sweetheart\nhome. They had both spent the evening at the\nhouse of one of the girl\u2019s relatives to whom Falk had\nintroduced himself. When they turned the corner of\nthe street in which the girl lives, they saw by the light\nof the street lamp that her father was leaning out of\nthe window\u2014he hives in a small house which belongs\nto him. Falk knocked at the garden gate; but\nnobody came to open it. At last he climbed over and\nwas on the other side attacked by a large dog ; he got\nthe better of the brute and shut it up in the dustbin.\n(Imagine the nervous Falk.) Then he compelled the\nporter to get up and open the gate. Now they had\ngained the yard and stood before the front door. He\nhammered it with a large stone, but no reply came\nfrom within; he searched the garden and found a\nladder, by means of which he reached the old man\u2019s\nwindow. Open the door, he shouted, or I\u2019ll smash the\nwindow !\n\nx\n", "\u2018* If you smash the window, you rascal,\u201d\u2019 yelled the\nold man, \u201c I\u2019Il shoot you!\u201d\n\nFalk immediately smashed the window.\n\nFor a few moments there was silence. Finally a\nvoice came from within the fortress :\n\n*\u201c You are my man! I consent.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cT\u2019m not fond of smashing windows,\u201d explained\nFalk, \u201c\u2018 but there\u2019s nothing I would not do to win your\ndaughter.\u201d\n\nThe matter was settled, and they became engaged.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether you know that Parliament has\nearried through its reorganization of the public offices,\ndoubling the salaries and the number of posts, so that\na young man in the first division is now in a position to\nmarry. Falk is going to be married in the autumn.\n\nHis wife will keep her post at the school. I know\nnext to nothing of the Woman\u2019s Question\u2014it doesn\u2019t\ninterest me\u2014but I believe that our generation will get\nrid of the last remnant of the Eastern conception\nwhich still clings to marriage. In the days to come,\nhusband and wife will enter into a partnership where\nboth will retain their independence; they will not try\nto convert each other, but will mutually respect their\nweaknesses, and live together in a life-long Kiendship\nwhich will never be strained by the demands of one of\nthe partners for amorous demonstrations.\n\nI feok upon Mrs. Nicholas Falk, the charitable she-\ndevil, as nothing more than a femme entretenue, and I\nam sure she does so herself. Most women marry for a\nhome where they need not work\u2014be their own mistress,\nasitisealled. \u2018The fact that marriage is on the decline\nis as much the woman\u2019s fault as the man\u2019s.\n\nBut I cannot make Falk out. He is studying\nnumismatiecs with an almost unnatural zeal; he told\nme the other day that he was engaged in writing a\ntext-book on numismatics, which he would endeavour\nto introduce into the schools where this science is to be\ntaught.\n\nHe never reads a paper ; he does not know what is\ngoing on in the world, and he seems to have abandoned\n", "the idea of writing. He lives only for his work and\nhis fianc\u00e9e, whom he worships.\n\nBut I don\u2019t trust his calm. Falk is a political\nfanatic, well aware that he would be consumed if he\nallowed the fire to burn freely ; therefore he tries to\nstifle it with hard, monotonous work; but I don\u2019t\nthink that he will succeed ; in spite of all his restraint\nthe day is bound to come when he will cast aside all\nself-control and burst out into fresh flames.\n\nBetween you and me\u2014I believe he belongs to one\nof those secret societies which are responsible for the\nreaction and militarism on the Continent. Not very\nlong ago, at the reading of the King\u2019s Speech in\nParliament, I saw him, dressed in a purple cloak, with\na feather in his hat, sitting at the foot of the throne\n(at the foot of the throne!) and I thought\u2014no, it\nwould be a sin to say what I thought. But when the\nPrime Minister read his Majesty\u2019s gracious proposi-\ntions respecting the state of the country and its needs,\nI saw a look in Falk\u2019s eyes which plainly said: What\non earth does his Majesty know of the condition and\nneeds of the country ?\n\nThat man, oh ! that man !\n\nI conclude my review without having forgotten\nanybody. Enough for to-day. You shall soon hear\nfrom me again.\n\nH. B. 1879.\n", "CHAPTER XXX\n\nEPILOGUE\nDovusBTLsss there is not another street in Stockholm\nas ugly, and not another house as old, as dirty, and\nas gloomy. The entrance gate has the inviting\nappearance of a disused gallows. The rubble stones\nin the yard have moved more closely together in the\ncourse of time, so that a few small blades of grass\nhave been able to shoot up. The house stands by\nitself, like an old hermit who has sought a solitary\nspot in which to collapse. There has once been an\nAssaying Office in the yard, and the outside walls are\nblackened with smoke. The chinks between the\nwindow frames and the walls are grown over, and\nthe house looks as if it had not washed its face or\neyes for a generation. \u2018The foundation has settled,\nand the building is stooping to the left. The leaking\ngutter has been weeping tears which have drawn\nblack furrows all over the front of the building ; the\nplastering is crumbling off here and there, and on\nwindy nights one can hear it rattling down the walls\ninto the street below. The house looks like an old\ndowager house of poverty, recklessness, carelessness,\nand vice.\n\nAnd yet there are two people who cannot pass\nthrough the street without stopping to look at the\nmiserable, frowning old building with emotion almost\namounting to love. To them the entrance gate is a\ntriumphal arch, the weeds and the gutter a green\nmeadow, and a murmuring brook, the black house a\ncharming ruin, containing lovely, rose-red memories.\nIt is more, even, for whenever they pass it, the air\n\n324\n", "vibrates with music, perfumes rise from the earth,\nand they see the sun shining even on the cloudiest\nautumn day; there have been times when they for-\ngot themselves so far as to kiss each other; but\nthey have always been a little mad, these good\npeople.\n\nThree years ago our young friend\u2014we may call\nhim friend since he repented of his youthful errors,\napologised to society, and became a respectable\nindividual, serving the country and wearing purple\nin the House of Parliament\u2014our young friend, I say,\nwas busy on the third floor of the ugly old house with\na sheet of pins between his lips, a hammer in his\ncoat-pocket, and a pair of pincers under his arm ; he\nwas standing on a ladder, putting up curtains in a\nsmall room, furnished only with a tiny sofa, a tiny\ndressing-table, a small desk, and a very small bed\nwith white curtains.\n\nIn the dining-room the faithful Isaac, in shirt-\nsleeves, was engaged in spreading paste on a piece\nof wallpaper, stretched on an ironing-board which\nrested on two chairs; he was whistling and singing\none unknown song after the other to quite unheard-of\ntunes. When he was tired of working, he prepared\nluncheon on an empty box standing before the\nwindow.\n\nOutside the sun was shining into the neighbour\u2019s\ngarden. It was a tiny garden squeezed between\nthe walls of the houses ; it had a pear tree in full\nbloom, and two elder bushes covered with blossoms ;\nbetween the gables a piece of blue sky was visible\nand the mast heads of the timber barges in the\nharbour.\n\nIsaac had been to the dairy; had bought sand-\nwiches and porter ; had papered the future mistress\u2019s\nroom ; had purchased oleanders and ivy, so that the\nlanding winiowe with their black frames should not\nshock the young wife as she entered her new home ;\nhe would have liked to paint them, but he was afraid\nthat she might object to the smell.\n", "A cab stopped before the front door.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Borg,\u201d said Isaac. \u2018*\u2018 What the dickens does\nhe want here? And that pest, Levin, is with\nhim!\u201d\n\nIt was a long visit, lasting ten minutes, and a dis-\nagreeable one; but Falk bore it patiently, like any\nother trial; he had for ever broken with the past ;\nin one respect at least ; in another he was bound, for\nhe had been compelled during the ten minutes to\nsign once more.\n\nThe next visitors were the sister-in-law, Mrs. Falk,\nand Mrs. Homan. They found the paper in the\ndining-room too dark, and the paper in the young\nwife\u2019s room too light. They thought the curtains in\nthe husband\u2019s room were not wide enough, the carpet\na bad match to the furniture, the clock old-fashioned,\nand the chandelier too dear for its plainness. One\npiece of furniture in the young wife\u2019s room especially\nroused their critical faculty, and gave rise to a long,\nwhispered conversation. They called the kitchen\nblack, the landing dirty, the entrance terrible ; but\notherwise they said everything was quite nice, much\nnicer than the yard, where there was not even a\nporter, led one to expect.\n\nThis was the second plague, and it passed like\neverything else in this world.\n\nBut Isaac had lost some of his gaiety after the\ncriticism of his wallpapers, and Falk realized for a\nmoment that it was a miserable hole. He opened\nthe windows to let out the evil spirits which had\ninvaded his pleasure garden. Isaae declared that\nduring the wedding days he would have the two\nwomen shut up in the debtors\u2019 prison, so as to keep\nthem safely away.\n\nAnd then\u2014then she came. He was standing at\nthe window, and he saw her when she was still too\nfar off to be seen; he expected to be believed\nwhen he maintained that she radiated light and that\nthe street through which she was walking was bathed\nin sunshine. Of course he could have told endless\n", "stories of her kindness, sweetness, and beauty ; but\nnot even she believed them, and it is not worth while\nrepeating them.\n\nShe entered her future home and found everything\ncharming. Isaac went into the kitchen to split\nsome wood and light the kitchen fire. Nobody missed\nhim until he returned with a tray bearing some cups\nof chocolate. It amused him; he knew that lovers\nnever miss anybody in the wide world, and he found\nthe terrible selfishness, which is called love, a very\namiable quality ; moreover, everybody admits that\nit is justified. .\n\n\u201cWhat people said about it?\u201d They said :\n\n*\u201c\u2018 Well, and so Falk is married ? \u201d\n\n\u201cIs he ? Whom did he marry ?\u201d\n\n\u201c\u201c A schoolmistress ! \u201d\n\n\u201c\u201cUgh! A woman with blue spectacles and short\nhair !\u201d\n\nAnd the questioner had all the information he\nwanted.\n\nIf the answer had been: \u2018\u2018He\u2019s married old\nKochstrom\u2019s daughter,\u2019\u2019 the second question would\nhave been: \u2018\u2018 Did he get any money with her ?\u201d\n\nThe world asks no further questions, and every-\nthing would be all right\u2014if this were all. But the\nworld demands that a couple which has three times\ngiven the clergyman the trouble to read the banns\nand the community to listen to them; which has\nforced its fellow-creatures to engage in genealogical\nresearch and send a reporter to the wedding\u2014the\nworld demands that such a couple shall be happy\u2014\nwoe to it if it is not!\n\nSupposing that on coming home from school, tired\nwith her work, angry at a slight, depressed because\nsome of her efforts have proved a failure, she should\nmeet a friend in the street who takes her hand and\nsays: \u2018\u201c* You don\u2019t look too happy, Elizabeth,\u201d then\nwoe to him !\n\nSupposing that on leaving his office, in despair\nbecause he has been overlooked instead of promoted,\n", "he should meet a friend who finds him looking\ndepressed, then woe to her !\n\nUnhappy people, if you dare to be anything but\nhappy !\n\nIt was a winter evening two or three years later ;\nshe was bending over her writing desk, correcting\ncopybooks, he was sitting in his room computing\nassessments of property. The pens were scribbling,\nthe clock was ticking, and the tea-kettle singing.\nWhenever he looked up from his documents at her\nsweet face, she raised her eyes, their glances met, and\nthey nodded to each other as if they had been parted\nfor a long time. And they continued working.\n\nBut finally he grew tired of his work.\n\n\u201cTalk to me a little,\u201d he pleaded.\n\nAnd she eagerly complied with his request.\n\n\u2018* But what do they talk about ?\u201d\n\nThe scoffer Borg once asked that question, when\nhe declared matrimony to be an impossibility from\nthe point of view of natural science.\n\nHe laid down the proposition that the moment\nmust come when every subject had been discussed,\nwhen each partner knew every thought and opinion\nof the other, and when absolute silence was bound\nto reign.\n\nThe fool !\n\nTHE END\nPRINTED BY\nBALLANTYNE & COMPANY\n\nLONDON ive\n"]
